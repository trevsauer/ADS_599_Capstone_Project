In IoT networks, the interacting nodes are inherently resource-constrained; this would render those nodes to be a source of cyber-attack targets. In this aspect, substantial efforts have been made, mainly through conventional cryptographic methods, to tackle the security and privacy concerns in IoT networks. Yet, the distinctive features of IoT nodes make conventional solutions inadequate to address the IoT network security spectrum. To cope with these concerns in IoT, a novel Conglomerate Edict based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is designed in this work. The proposed IDS amalgamates the functioning of several decision based machine learning classifiers to overwhelm the security threats. Detecting an unknown attack seems to be a reverie in IoT security; whereas, the hybrid ensemble discernment classifier in the proposed IDS effectively detects the known as well as unknown attacks with paramount detection rate. Overall, numerous high performance metrics are evaluated in this work to reveal the proposed efficacy in assuring scalable and secured IoT data transmission.",[],"['Internet of Things', 'conglomerate edict based intrusion detection system', 'hybrid ensemble discernment classifier', 'cyber attacks and machine learning classifiers']","['Engineering', 'Engineering, general']","[{'id': '2887', 'term': 'Technology and Engineering'}]",

In an effort to enable secondary data analyses, we propose a workflow to retrieve unreported subgroup survival data from published Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots. Methods We developed KMSubtraction , an R-package that retrieves patients from unreported subgroups by matching participants on KM plots of the overall cohort to participants on KM plots of a known subgroup with follow-up time. By excluding matched patients, the opposing unreported subgroup may be retrieved. Reproducibility and limits of error of the KMSubtraction workflow were assessed by comparing unmatched patients against the original survival data of subgroups from published datasets and simulations. Monte Carlo simulations were utilized to evaluate the limits of error of KMSubtraction . Results The validation exercise found no material systematic error and demonstrates the robustness of KMSubtraction in deriving unreported subgroup survival data. Limits of error were small and negligible on marginal Cox proportional hazard models comparing reconstructed and original survival data of unreported subgroups. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that datasets with high reported subgroup proportion ( r  = 0.467, p  < 0.001), small dataset size ( r  = − 0.374, p  < 0.001) and high proportion of missing data in the unreported subgroup ( r  = 0.553, p  < 0.001) were associated with uncertainty are likely to yield high limits of error with KMSubtraction. Conclusion KMSubtraction demonstrates robustness in deriving survival data from unreported subgroups. The limits of error of KMSubtraction derived from converged Monte Carlo simulations may guide the interpretation of reconstructed survival data of unreported subgroups.",[],,"['Medicine & Public Health', 'Theory of Medicine/Bioethics', 'Statistical Theory and Methods', 'Statistics for Life Sciences, Medicine, Health Sciences']","[{'id': '4207', 'term': 'Bioethics'}, {'id': '3921', 'term': 'Statistical Theory and Methods'}, {'id': '5065', 'term': 'Biostatistics'}]",

An accurate iris segmentation helps to increase the accuracy of iris recognition in any biometric system. However, the robustness and efficiency of conventional iris segmentation methodologies are facing massive challenges in a non-cooperative environment because of unfavorable factors, for instance, blur, occlusion, off-axis, low resolution, motion, and specular reflections. These factors severely affect the accuracy of the iris segmentation approaches. In this article, a novel Iris segmentation approach has been obtained with V-Net architectures to accurately localize the boundaries of the iris image with semantic segmentation mask synthesis. A novel image processing technique: YCrCb and HSV color space, has also been utilized to select saliency point set and recover the iris boundary. A detailed analytical study has been obtained with the U-Net and its modified architecture to understand the drawbacks of the U-Net architectures and how V-Net can overcome them. Experimental Results consolidate that the iris segmentation with V-Net achieves 95.6% mean IOU value, whereas U-Net can only achieve 92.3%. So V-Net can easily outperform the existing state-of-the-art approaches on the challenging UBIRIS database.",[],"['Iris segmentation', 'U-Net', 'YCrCb', 'HSV', 'V-Net', 'Biometrics']","['Computer Science', 'Computer Science, general', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Information Systems and Communication Service', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics']","[{'id': '2971', 'term': 'Computer Science'}, {'id': '4767', 'term': 'Computer Engineering and Networks'}, {'id': '5482', 'term': 'Software Engineering'}, {'id': '2972', 'term': 'Data Structures and Information Theory'}, {'id': '4631', 'term': 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics'}]",

The camera resolution is one of the most important parameters that affects the measurement accuracy. Although current high-resolution (HR) cameras have improved the accuracy of scanners, limitations such as high power consumption, high cost, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) have remained. This paper investigates the effect of the camera linear movement (CLM) and the laser rotational movement (LRM) on the measurement accuracy improvement of low resolution/cost laser triangulation scanner. For this purpose, a mathematical model was introduced to calculate the effect of CLM and LRM in the depth reconstruction uncertainty of these scanners. Then, synthetic experiments were performed to evaluate the proposed mathematical model. Finally, real experiments were established to show the advantages of the proposed algorithm to improve the measurement accuracy of the low-resolution (LR) laser triangulation systems practically. The proposed algorithm can be applied in many image processing fields, including reverse engineering, 3D measuring, and 3D modeling.

Several studies have found a correlation between low cholesterol and depression, but the results are inconsistent. Methods Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2018 were utilized in this cross-sectional study. The analysis of the relationship between cholesterol and depression was performed at three levels: low total cholesterol, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) people with low (<4.14 mmol/L) or normal (4.14-5.16 mmol/L) total cholesterol for Sample 1; people with low (<1 mmol/L) or normal (≥1 mmol/L) HDL cholesterol levels for Sample 2; and people with low (<1.8 mmol/L) or normal (1.8-3.4 mmol/L) LDL cholesterol levels for Sample 3; and (2) people who completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 depression scale. Age, sex, educational level, race, marital status, self-rated health, alcohol status, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), poverty income ratio, physical function, comorbidities, and prescription use were considered potential confounders. The missing data were handled by multiple imputations of chained equations. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between low cholesterol and depression. Results After controlling for potential confounding factors in the multivariate logistic regression, no association was observed between depression and low total cholesterol (OR=1.0, 95% CI: 0.9-1.2), low LDL cholesterol (OR=1.0, 95% CI: 0.8-1.4), or low HDL cholesterol (OR=0.9, 95% CI: 0.8-1.1). The results stratified by sex also showed no association between low total cholesterol, low LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol and depression in either men or women. Conclusion This population-based study did not support the assumption that low cholesterol was related to a higher risk of depression.

This study assessed the relationship between SUA and each dyslipidaemia component in Dong, Miao, and Bouyei populations in Guizhou by sex and ethnicities and investigated the dose-response relationship. Methods In total, 16,092 participants aged 30–79 years from The China Multi-Ethnic Cohort (CMEC) Study were examined. Multivariable logistic regression models were applied to explore the relationship between SUA and each dyslipidaemia component by sex and three ethnicities. The dose-response associations between SUA and various dyslipidaemias were investigated using restricted cubic spline regression. Results After controlling for confounding factors, the SUA level in total participants positively correlated with each dyslipidaemia component, and women had higher odds ratios (ORs) for each dyslipidaemia component than men ( P for trend < 0.001). At the SUA level > 6.37 mg/dL, ORs (95% CI) for dyslipidaemia in the Dong, Miao and Bouyei were 2.89 (2.00–4.19), 2.43 (1.70–3.48), and 3.26 (2.23–4.78), respectively. When the SUA concentration increased by 1 mg/dL, the ORs (95% CI) for total dyslipidaemia was 1.31 (1.24–1.37). A positive dose-response but nonlinear association was found between SUA and total dyslipidaemia, high total cholesterol, and low HDL, whereas an inverse U-shaped association was found between SUA and high LDL-C ( P -nonlinear< 0.0001). Conclusion The SUA level was positively correlated with each dyslipidaemia component in Dong, Miao, and Bouyei adults, and sex and ethnic differences were also found.

The genetic diagnosis of our patients included infantile convulsions and paroxysmal choreoathetosis syndrome and episodic ataxia due to “pathogenic homozygous mutation of PRRT2 gene,” glucose transporter type 1 deficiency-exercise induced dyskinesia due to “De Novo pathogenic heterozygous missense mutation of exon 4 of SLC2A1 gene,” aromatic L amino acid decarboxylase deficiency due to “pathogenic homozygous mutation of the DDC gene,” myopathy with extrapyramidal signs due to “likely pathogenic homozygous mutations of the MICU1 gene,” mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency due to “homozygous variant of uncertain significance (VUS) of HADHB gene” and glutaric aciduria II with serine deficiency due to “homozygous VUS for both ETFDH and PHGDH genes.” After receiving the treatment as per recognized treatment protocols, two patients showed complete resolution of symptoms and the rest showed variable responses. Conclusion Identifying the genetic etiology of our patients guided us to provide either disease-specific treatment or redirected our management plan. Hence, highlighting the value of molecular genetic analysis to avoid the diagnostic odyssey and identify treatable MDs.",[],"['Ataxia', 'Dyskinesia', 'Dystonia', 'Genotype', 'Movement disorders', 'Phenotype', 'Whole-exome sequencing']","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Medicine/Public Health, general']","[{'id': '2977', 'term': 'Public Health'}]",
