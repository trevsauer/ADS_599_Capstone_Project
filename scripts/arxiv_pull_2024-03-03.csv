q-Boson approach to multiparticle correlations,"['D. V. Anchishkin', 'A. M. Gavrilik', 'N. Z. Iorgov']",2000-10-03T10:25:50Z,2000-10-03T10:25:50Z,"An approach is proposed enabling to effectively describe, for relativistic
heavy-ion collisions, the observed deviation from unity of the intercept
\lambda (measured value corresponding to zero relative momentum {\bf p} of two
registered identical pions or kaons) of the two-particle correlation function
C(p,K). The approach uses q-deformed oscillators and the related picture of
ideal gas of q-bosons. In effect, the intercept \lambda is connected with
deformation parameter q. For a fixed value of q, the model predicts specific
dependence of \lambda on pair mean momentum {\bf K} so that, when |{\bf
K}|\gsim 500 - 600 MeV/c for pions or when |{\bf K}|\gsim 700 - 800 MeV/c for
kaons, the intercept \lambda tends to a constant which is less than unity and
determined by q. If q is fixed to be the same for pions and kaons, the
intercepts \lambda_\pi and \lambda_K essentially differ at small mean momenta
{\bf K}, but tend to be equal at {\bf K} large enough (|{\bf K}|\gsim 800MeV/c)
where the effect of resonance decays can be neglected. We argue that it is of
basic interest to check in the experiments on heavy ion collisions: (i) the
exact shape of dependence \lambda = \lambda({\bf K}), and (ii) whether for
|{\bf K}| \gsim 800 MeV/c the resulting \lambda_\pi and \lambda_K indeed
coincide.",http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0010019v1,['hep-ph'],['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']
Gauge theory of things alive and universal dynamics,['G. Mack'],1994-11-28T12:26:32Z,1994-11-28T12:26:32Z,"Positing complex adaptive systems made of agents with relations between them
that can be composed, it follows that they can be described by gauge theories
similar to elementary particle theory and general relativity. By definition, a
universal dynamics is able to determine the time development of any such system
without need for further specification. The possibilities are limited, but one
of them - reproduction fork dynamics - describes DNA replication and is the
basis of biological life on earth. It is a universal copy machine and a
renormalization group fixed point. A universal equation of motion in continuous
time is also presented.",http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-lat/9411059v1,['hep-lat'],['High Energy Physics - Lattice']
Solar neutrinos: global analysis and implications for SNO,"['John N. Bahcall', 'Plamen I. Krastev', 'Alexei Yu. Smirnov']",2001-03-16T00:36:02Z,2001-03-20T14:53:05Z,"We present a global analysis of all the available solar neutrino data
treating consistently the 8B and hep neutrino fluxes as free parameters. The
analysis reveals at 99.7% C.L. eight currently-allowed discrete regions in
two-neutrino oscillation space, five regions corresponding to active neutrinos
and three corresponding to sterile neutrinos. Most of the allowed solutions are
robust with respect to changes in the analysis procedure, but the traditional
vacuum solution is fragile. The globally-permitted range of the 8B neutrino
flux, 0.45 to 1.95 in units of the BP2000 flux, is comparable to the 3 sigma
range allowed by the standard solar model. We discuss the implications for SNO
of a low mass, Delta m^2 ~ 6 times 10^{-12} eV^2, vacuum oscillation solution,
previously found by Raghavan, and by Krastev and Petcov, but absent in recent
analyses that included Super-Kamiokande data. For the SNO experiment, we
present refined predictions for the charged-current rate and the ratio of the
neutral-current rate to charged-current rate. The predicted charged-current
rate can be clearly distinguished from the no-oscillation rate only for the LMA
solution. The predicted ratio of the neutral-current rate to charged-current
rate is distinguishable from the no-oscillation ratio for the LMA, SMA, LOW,

Restoration of chiral symmetry in excited hadrons,['L. Ya. Glozman'],2004-10-13T14:56:43Z,2004-10-13T14:56:43Z,"Physics of the low-lying and high-lying hadrons in the light flavor sector is
reviewed. While the low-lying hadrons are strongly affected by the spontaneous
breaking of chiral symmetry, in the high-lying hadrons the chiral symmetry is
restored. A manifestation of the chiral symmetry restoration in excited hadrons
is a persistence of the chiral multiplet structure in both baryon and meson
spectra. Meson and baryon chiral multiplets are classified. A relation between

  semiclassical approximation and large N_c",['L. Ya. Glozman'],2004-11-21T10:17:31Z,2005-06-22T08:01:15Z,"In quantum systems with large $n$ (radial quantum number) or large angular
momentum the semiclassical (WKB) approximation is valid. A physical content of
the semiclassical approximation is that the quantum fluctuations effects are
suppressed and vanish asymptotically. The chiral as well as $U(1)_A$ breakings
in QCD result from quantum fluctuations. Hence these breakings must be
suppressed high in the spectrum and the spectrum of high-lying hadrons must
exhibit $U(2)_L \times U(2)_R$ symmetry of the classical QCD Lagrangian. This
argument can be made stronger for mesons in the large $N_c$ limit. In this
limit all mesons are stable against strong decays and the spectrum is infinite.
Hence, one can excite mesons of arbitrary large size with arbitrary large
action, in which case the semiclassical limit is manifest. Actually we do not
need the exact $N_c=\infty$ limit. For any large action there always exist such
$N_c$ that the isolated mesons with such an action do exist and can be
described semiclassically. From the empirical fact that we observe multiplets
of chiral and $U(1)_A$ groups high in the hadron spectrum it follows that
$N_c=3$ is large enough for this purpose.",http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0411281v4,['hep-ph'],['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']

2004, which presented a comprehensive review of the status of the field at that

program concluded only to give birth to BESIII; the $B$-factories and CLEO-c
flourished; quarkonium production and polarization measurements at HERA and the
Tevatron matured; and heavy-ion collisions at RHIC have opened a window on the
deconfinement regime. All these experiments leave legacies of quality,
precision, and unsolved mysteries for quarkonium physics, and therefore beg for
continuing investigations. The plethora of newly-found quarkonium-like states
unleashed a flood of theoretical investigations into new forms of matter such
as quark-gluon hybrids, mesonic molecules, and tetraquarks. Measurements of the
spectroscopy, decays, production, and in-medium behavior of c\bar{c}, b\bar{b},
and b\bar{c} bound states have been shown to validate some theoretical
approaches to QCD and highlight lack of quantitative success for others. The
intriguing details of quarkonium suppression in heavy-ion collisions that have
emerged from RHIC have elevated the importance of separating hot- and
cold-nuclear-matter effects in quark-gluon plasma studies. This review

mass accretion or a change in the high-density equation of state. We consider
the possibility that black hole formation happens when the flux of neutrinos is
still measurably high. If this occurs, then the neutrino signal from the
supernova will be terminated abruptly (the transition takes $\lesssim 0.5$ ms).
The properties and duration of the signal before the cutoff are important
measures of both the physics and astrophysics of the cooling proto-neutron
star. For the event rates expected in present and proposed detectors, the
cutoff will generally appear sharp, thus allowing model-independent
time-of-flight mass tests for the neutrinos after the cutoff. If black hole
formation occurs relatively early, within a few ($\sim 1$) seconds after core
collapse, then the expected luminosities are of order $L_{BH} = 10^{52}$ erg/s
per flavor. In this case, the neutrino mass sensitivity can be extraordinary.
For a supernova at a distance $D = 10$ kpc, SuperKamiokande can detect a
$\bar{\nu}_e$ mass down to 1.8 eV by comparing the arrival times of the
high-energy and low-energy neutrinos in $\bar{\nu}_e + p \to e^+ + n$. This
test will also measure the cutoff time, and will thus allow a mass test of
$\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$ relative to $\bar{\nu}_e$. Assuming that $\nu_\mu$ and
$\nu_\tau$ are nearly degenerate, as suggested by the atmospheric neutrino
results, masses down to about 6 eV can be probed with a proposed lead detector
of mass $M_D = 4$ kton (OMNIS). Remarkably, the neutrino mass sensitivity
scales as $(D/L_{BH} M_D)^{1/2}$. Therefore, {\it direct} sensitivity to all
three neutrino masses in the interesting few-eV range is realistically
possible; {\it there are no other known techniques that have this capability}.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0010398v2,['astro-ph'],['Astrophysics']

dense medium, the implications of the existence of a light scalar-isoscalar
meson (which we call $\sigma$ throughout this report) are discussed in the
vacuum and in the medium. Special emphasis is put on its relation to the
fluctuation of the chiral order parameter $<\bar{q}q>$. In the vacuum, the
$\sigma$-meson is an elusive resonance corresponding to a pole deep in the
second Riemann sheet of the $\pi$-$\pi$ scattering matrix in the $I$=$J$=0
channel. This is because the the amplitude fluctuation of $<\bar{q}q>$
(corresponding to {\rm ur}-$\sigma$) and the phase fluctuation of $<\bar{q}q>$
(2 pion states) mix strongly in the vacuum. As the temperature and/or density
of the system increase, however, there arises a softening of this complex pole
due to the partial restoration of chiral symmetry. Such soft modes play a key
role to understand the QCD phase structure. We demonstrate that even a slight
softening of the $\sigma$ mode could induce strong spectral enhancement and
strong $\pi$-$\pi$ correlation near the 2$m_{\pi}$ threshold in the $I$=$J$=0
channel, which thereby can be a signature of the partial restoration of chiral
symmetry. Such spectral enhancement may be seen not only in hot matter created
by the relativistic heavy ion collisions but also in cold matter (heavy nuclei)
probed by photons and hadrons. Relevance of the partial restoration of chiral
symmetry in heavy nuclei with the recent data by the CHAOS and CB

field to externally imposed boundary conditions. In reality, however, no
interaction is strong enough to enforce a boundary condition on all frequencies
of a fluctuating field. We construct a more physical model of the situation by
coupling the fluctuating field to a smooth background potential that implements
the boundary condition in a certain limit. To study this problem, we develop
general new methods to compute renormalized one--loop quantum energies and
energy densities. We use analytic properties of scattering data to compute
Green's functions in time--independent background fields at imaginary momenta.
Our calculational method is particularly useful for numerical studies of
singular limits because it avoids terms that oscillate or require cancellation
of exponentially growing and decaying factors. To renormalize, we identify
potentially divergent contributions to the Casimir energy with low orders in
the Born series to the Green's function. We subtract these contributions and
add back the corresponding Feynman diagrams, which we combine with counterterms
fixed by imposing standard renormalization conditions on low--order Green's
functions. The resulting Casimir energy and energy density are finite
functionals for smooth background potentials. In general, however, the Casimir
energy diverges in the boundary condition limit. This divergence is real and
reflects the infinite energy needed to constrain a fluctuating field on all
energy scales; renormalizable quantum field theories have no place for ad hoc
surface counterterms. We apply our methods to simple examples to illustrate
cases where these subtleties invalidate the conclusions of the boundary
condition approach.",http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0207120v2,['hep-th'],['High Energy Physics - Theory']

like the surface tension, which are obtained by deforming the surface, cannot
be defined independently of the details of the coupling between the field and

properties from the sum rule with good stability in a remarkably wide Borel
window. The appearance of its valid window originates from a favorable setup of
the correlation functions with the aid of it chirality of the interpolating
fields on the analogy of the Weinberg sum rule for the vector currents. Our
setup leads to large suppression of the continuum contributions which have
spoiled the Borel stability in the previous analyses, and consequently enhances
importance of the higher-dimensional contributions of the OPE, which are
indispensable for investigating the pentaquark properties. Implementing the OPE
analysis up to dimension 15, we find that the sum rules for the chiral-even and
odd parts independently give the Theta^{+} mass of 1.68 pm 0.22 GeV with
uncertainties of the condensate values. Our sum rule indeed gives rather flat
Borel curves almost independent of the continuum thresholds both for the mass
and pole residue. Finally, we also discuss possible isolation of the observed

The strength of the \pi_n^0 \gamma \gamma coupling, where n=0 denotes the

The effect is material for n \neq 0. The \gamma* \pi_n \gamma* transition form

(4\pi^2/3) (f_{\pi_n}/Q^2) at large Q^2. For all pseudoscalars but the

physics beyond the standard deuteron model for their interpretation. Future
$b_1$ studies could shed light on a new field of hadron physics. In particular,
detailed experimental studies of $b_1$ will start soon at the Thomas Jefferson

seen to compare favourably with such fits. However, the gluon FF is markedly
different. Notably, although FF evolution equations do not themselves guarantee
momentum conservation, inclusion of a gluon FF which, for four quark flavours,
distributes roughly 11% of the total light-front momentum fraction, is
sufficient to restore momentum conservation under evolution. Overall,

the other low lying nucleon resonance amplitudes: the magnitude of the
transverse helicity amplitudes. The transition helicity amplitudes are defined
in terms of square transfer momentum $q^2$, or $Q^2=-q^2$. Near the photon
point ($Q^2=0$) there is a significant difference in the magnitude of the
transverse amplitudes: $A_{3/2}$ is very large and $A_{1/2}$ is very small.
This atypical behavior contrasts with the relation between the amplitudes at
the pseudothreshold (the limit where the nucleon and the $N(1520)$ are both at
rest and $Q^2 <0$), where $A_{3/2} = A_{1/2}/\sqrt{3}$, and also in the large
$Q^2$ region, where theory and data suggest that $A_{3/2}$ is suppressed
relative to $A_{1/2}$. In the present work, we look for the source of the
suppression of the $A_{1/2}$ amplitude at $Q^2=0$. The result is easy to
understand in first approximation, when we look into the relation between the
transverse amplitudes and the elementary form factors, defined by a gauge
invariant parametrization of the $\gamma^\ast N \to N(1520)$ transition
current, near $Q^2=0$. There is a partial cancellation between contributions of
two {\it elementary} form factors near $Q^2=0$. We conclude, however, that the
correlation between the these elementary form factors at $Q^2=0$ is not
sufficient to explain the transverse amplitude data below $Q^2 = 1$ GeV$^2$.
The description the dependence of the transverse amplitudes on $Q^2$ requires
the determination of the scale of variation of the elementary form factors in
the range $Q^2=0$...0.5 GeV$^2$, a region with almost non existent data. We
conclude at the end that the low $Q^2$ data for the transverse amplitudes can
be well described when we relate the scale of variation of the elementary form
factors with the nucleon dipole form factor.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10654v2,[],[]

than 50% from its contribution to the Xi^0 magnetic moment. This hitherto
unforeseen result leads to the value G_M^s(0) = -0.16 +/- 0.18 with a

Does one observe chiral symmetry restoration in baryon spectrum?,"['T. D. Cohen', 'L. Ya. Glozman']",2002-01-25T14:29:15Z,2002-01-25T14:29:15Z,"It has recently been suggested that the parity doublet structure seen in the
spectrum of highly excited baryons may be due to effective chiral symmetry
restoration for these states. We review the recent developments in this field.
We demonstrate with a simple quantum-mechanical example that it is a very
natural property of quantum systems that a symmetry breaking effect which is
important for the low-lying spectrum of the system, can become unimportant for
the highly-lying states; the highly lying states reveal a multiplet structure
of nearly degenerate states. Using the well established concepts of
quark-hadron duality, asymptotic freedom in QCD and validity of the operator
product expansion in QCD we show that the spectral densities obtained with the
local currents that are connected to each other via chiral transformations,
very high in the spectrum must coincide. Hence effects of spontaneous breaking
of chiral symmetry in QCD vacuum that are crucially important for the low-lying
spectra, become irrelevant for the highly-lying states. Then to the extent that
identifiable hadronic resonances still exist in the continuum spectrum at high
excitations this implies that the highly excited hadrons must fall into
multiplets associated with the representations of the chiral group. We
demonstrate that this is indeed the case for meson spectra in the large $N_c$
limit. All possible parity-chiral multiplets are classified for baryons and it
is demonstrated that the existing data on highly excited $N$ and $\Delta$
states at masses of 2 GeV and higher is consistent with approximate chiral
symmetry restoration. However new experimental studies are needed to achieve
any definitive conclusions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0201242v1,['hep-ph'],['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']

$SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ symmetry of QCD is restored high in the spectrum but
also the $ U(1)_A$ symmetry. This means that it is not a confining interaction
in QCD which triggers the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. The
restoration of the $U(2)_L\times U(2)_R$ symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian implies
the appearance of multiplets of this group high in the hadron spectra. Such
type of multiplets is naturally explained within the string picture of
confinement. It also supports the scenario that the $U(1)_A$ breaking is
related to instantons and not to the gluonic interaction responsible for
confinement.",http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0205072v2,['hep-ph'],['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']

This leads to a sizeable reduction of the uncertainties in the strange mass
from tau decays. Nevertheless, the resulting m_s value is still rather
sensitive to the moment of the invariant mass distribution which is used for
the determination, as well as the size of the quark-mixing matrix element
|V_us|. Imposing the unitarity fit for the CKM matrix, we obtain m_s(2

mesons including p-wave non-strange charmed mesons, $D_{sj}(2317)$ and

$D_{sj}(2632)$ etc; (3) charmonium and charmonium-like states such as X(3872),
Y(4260), X(3940), Y(3940), Z(3930) etc. The effect from the nearby S-wave open
channels on the quark model spectrum above or near strong decay threshold is
emphasized. Dynamical lattice simulations of $D K$ and $D^0\bar D^{\ast 0}$

emergent phenomena in QCD modulate the magnitude of flavour-symmetry breaking:
it is markedly smaller than one might expect based on the difference between

use of such nonperturbatively broadened PDAs in leading-order, leading-twist
formulae for hard exclusive processes instead of the asymptotic PDA associated

Among them, twist-two functions are related by the Callan-Gross type relation

structure of exotic hadron candidates. First, the constituent counting rule of
perturbative QCD can be used for finding internal configurations of an exotic
hadron candidate. It is because the number of constituents ($n$), which
participate in the exclusive reaction, is found by the scaling behavior of the
cross section $d\sigma/dt \propto 1/s^{n-2}$ at large momentum transfer, where
$s$ is the center-of-mass energy squared. As an example, we show that the
internal structure of $\Lambda \, (1405)$ should be found, for example, by the
reaction $\pi^- + p \to K^0 + \Lambda (1405)$. Second, the internal structure
of exotic hadron candidates should be investigated by hadron tomography with
generalized parton distributions (GPDs) and generalized distribution amplitudes
(GDAs) in exclusive reactions. Exotic nature should be reflected in the GPDs
which contain two factors, longitudinal parton distributions as indicated by
the constituent counting rule and transverse form factors as suggested by the
hadron size. The GDAs should be investigated by the two-photon process
$\gamma^* \gamma \to h\bar h$, for example $h=f_0$ or $a_0$, in
electron-positron annihilation. Since the GDAs contain information on a
time-like form factor, exotic nature should be found by studying the $h\bar h$
invariant mass dependence of the cross section. The internal structure of
exotic hadron candidates should be clarified by the exclusive reactions at

Valence-quark distribution functions in the kaon and pion,"['Chen Chen', 'Lei Chang', 'Craig D. Roberts', 'Shaolong Wan', 'Hong-Shi Zong']",2016-02-03T22:39:15Z,2016-02-03T22:39:15Z,"We describe expressions for pion and kaon dressed-quark distribution
functions that incorporate contributions from gluons which bind quarks into
these mesons and hence overcome a flaw of the commonly used handbag
approximation. The distributions therewith obtained are purely valence in
character, ensuring that dressed-quarks carry all a meson's momentum at a
characteristic hadronic scale and vanishing as $(1-x)^2$ when Bjorken-$x\to 1$.
Comparing such distributions within the pion and kaon, it is apparent that the
size of SU(3)-flavour symmetry breaking in meson parton distribution functions
is modulated by the flavour dependence of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking.
Corrections to these leading-order formulae may be divided into two classes,
responsible for shifting dressed-quark momentum into glue and sea-quarks.
Working with available empirical information, we build an algebraic framework
that is capable of expressing the principal impact of both classes of
corrections. This enables a realistic comparison with experiment which allows
us to identify and highlight basic features of measurable pion and kaon
valence-quark distributions. We find that whereas roughly two-thirds of the
pion's light-front momentum is carried by valence dressed-quarks at a
characteristic hadronic scale, this fraction rises to 95% in the kaon; evolving
distributions with these features to a scale typical of available Drell-Yan
data produces a kaon-to-pion ratio of u-quark distributions that is in
agreement with the single existing data set; and predict a u-quark distribution
within the pion that agrees with a modern reappraisal of $\pi N$ Drell-Yan

The pion: an enigma within the Standard Model,"['Tanja Horn', 'Craig D. Roberts']",2016-02-12T11:22:22Z,2016-02-12T11:22:22Z,"Almost 50 years after the discovery of gluons & quarks, we are only just
beginning to understand how QCD builds the basic bricks for nuclei: neutrons,
protons, and the pions that bind them. QCD is characterised by two emergent
phenomena: confinement & dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB). They are
expressed with great force in the character of the pion. In turn, pion
properties suggest that confinement & DCSB are closely connected. As both a
Nambu-Goldstone boson and a quark-antiquark bound-state, the pion is unique in
Nature. Developing an understanding of its properties is thus critical to
revealing basic features of the Standard Model. We describe experimental
progress in this direction, made using electromagnetic probes, highlighting
both improvements in the precision of charged-pion form factor data, achieved
in the past decade, and new results on the neutral-pion transition form factor.
Both challenge existing notions of pion structure. We also provide a
theoretical context for these empirical advances, first explaining how DCSB
works to guarantee that the pion is unnaturally light; but also, nevertheless,
ensures the pion is key to revealing the mechanisms that generate nearly all
the mass of hadrons. Our discussion unifies the charged-pion elastic and
neutral-pion transition form factors, and the pion's twist-2 parton
distribution amplitude. It also indicates how studies of the charged-kaon form
factor can provide significant contributions. Importantly, recent predictions
for the large-$Q^2$ behaviour of the pion form factor can be tested by
experiments planned at JLab 12. Those experiments will extend precise
charged-pion form factor data to momenta that can potentially serve in
validating factorisation theorems in QCD, exposing the transition between the

factors are dominated by the same physical processes. Those relations are
improved in order to satisfy a fundamental constraint between the electric and
Coulomb quadrupole form factors in the long wavelength limit, when the photon
three-momentum vanishes (Siegert's theorem). Inspired by those relations, we
study alternative parametrizations for the neutron electric form factor. The
parameters of the new form are then determined by a combined fit to the

We obtain a very good description of the $G_E$ and $G_C$ data when we combine
the pion cloud contributions with small valence quark contributions to the

of the data is obtained when the second momentum of $G_{En}$ is $r_n^4 \simeq

Global Fit to Modified Neutrino Couplings and the Cabibbo-Angle Anomaly,"['Antonio M. Coutinho', 'Andreas Crivellin', 'Claudio Andrea Manzari']",2019-12-18T19:00:01Z,2020-10-27T09:45:14Z,"Recently, discrepancies of up to $4\,\sigma$ between the different

could be explained by lepton flavour universality (LFU) violating New Physics
(NP) in the neutrino sector. However, modified neutrino couplings to Standard
Model gauge bosons also affect many other observables sensitive to LFU
violation which have to be taken into account in order to assess the viability
of this explanation. Therefore, we perform a model-independent global analysis
in a Bayesian approach and find that the tension in the Cabibbo angle is
significantly reduced, while the agreement with other data is also mostly
improved. In fact, non-zero modifications of electron and muon neutrino
couplings are preferred at more than 99\% CL. Still, since constructive effects
in the muon sector are necessary, simple models with right-handed neutrinos
(whose global fit we update as a by-product) cannot fully explain data,

the spectrum as listed in the PDG tables are often two states. The story began
with the $\Lambda(1405)$, when in 2001, using unitarized chiral perturbation
theory, it was observed that there are two poles in the complex plane, one
close to the $\bar{K}p$ and the other close to the $\pi\Sigma$ threshold. This
was later understood combining the SU(3) limit and group-theoretical arguments.
Different unitarization approaches that all lead to the two-pole structure have
been considered in the mean time, showing some spread in the pole positions.
This fact is now part of the PDG book, though it is not yet listed in the
summary tables. Here, I will discuss the open ends and critically review
approaches that can not deal with this issue. In the meson sector some excited
charm mesons are good candidates for such a two-pole structure. Next, I
consider in detail the $D_0^*(2300)$, that is another candidate for this
scenario. Combining lattice QCD with chiral unitary approaches in the finite
volume, the precise data of the Hadron Spectrum Collaboration for
coupled-channel $D\pi$, $D\eta$, $D_s\bar{K}$ scattering in the isospin $I=1/2$
channel indeed reveal its two-pole structure. Further states in the heavy meson

commonly used to derive constraints on right-handed currents. Further, in
addition to the CKM element $V_{us}$ from kaon decays, $V_{ud}$ from $\beta$
decays is a critical input for the test of CKM unitarity. Here, we point out
that the available information on $\beta$ decays can be re-interpreted as a
stringent test of lepton flavor universality (LFU). In fact, we find that the
ratio of $V_{us}$ from kaon decays over $V_{us}$ from $\beta$ decays (assuming
CKM unitarity) is extremely sensitive to LFU violation (LFUV) in
$W$-$\mu$-$\nu$ couplings thanks to a CKM enhancement by $(V_{ud}/V_{us})^2\sim

be viewed as further evidence for LFUV, fitting into the existing picture
exhibited by semi-leptonic $B$ decays and the anomalous magnetic moments of

far the largest and has been evaluated up to and including
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha^5)$ with negligible numerical uncertainty. The electroweak
contribution is suppressed by $(m_\mu/M_W)^2$ and only shows up at the level of
the seventh significant digit. It has been evaluated up to two loops and is
known to better than one percent. Hadronic contributions are the most difficult
to calculate and are responsible for almost all of the theoretical uncertainty.
The leading hadronic contribution appears at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^2)$ and is due
to hadronic vacuum polarization, whereas at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^3)$ the
hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution appears. Given the low
characteristic scale of this observable, these contributions have to be
calculated with nonperturbative methods, in particular, dispersion relations

Moreover, proceeding from GTMDs to generalised parton distributions (GPDs), it
is found that the pion's mass distribution form factor is harder than its
electromagnetic form factor, which is harder than the gravitational pressure
distribution form factor; the pressure in the neighbourhood of the pion's core
is commensurate with that at the centre of a neutron star; the shear pressure
is maximal when confinement forces become dominant within the pion; and the
spatial distribution of transversely polarised quarks within the pion is
asymmetric. Regarding transverse momentum dependent distribution functions

The simplest Wigner distribution associated with the pion's twist-two

with a pattern of separated energy scales qualifying it as special probe of
complex environments. Its multiscale nature has made a description in Quantum
Field Theory particularly difficult up to the advent of Nonrelativistic
Effective Field Theories. We will focus on systems made by two or more heavy

us to make calculations with unprecedented precision when high order
perturbative calculations are possible and to systematically factorize short
from long range contributions where observables are sensitive to the
nonperturbative dynamics of QCD. Such effective field theory treatment can be
extended at finite temperature and in presence of gluonic and light quark
excitations. We will show that in this novel theoretical framework, quarkonium
can play a crucial role for a number of problems at the frontier of our

determined bottom-charmed meson masses using a non-relativistic constituent

continuing to our study of the $B_c$ sector, we calculate the relevant
radiative decay widths and hadronic transition rates between $c\bar b$ states

Evidence for intrinsic charm quarks in the proton,"['Richard D.

in terms of quarks and gluons. The proton is a state of two up quarks and one
down quark bound by gluons, but quantum theory predicts that in addition there
is an infinite number of quark-antiquark pairs. Both light and heavy quarks,
whose mass is respectively smaller or bigger than the mass of the proton, are
revealed inside the proton in high-energy collisions. However, it is unclear
whether heavy quarks also exist as a part of the proton wavefunction, which is
determined by non-perturbative dynamics and accordingly unknown: so-called
intrinsic heavy quarks. It has been argued for a long time that the proton
could have a sizable intrinsic component of the lightest heavy quark, the charm
quark. Innumerable efforts to establish intrinsic charm in the proton have
remained inconclusive. Here we provide evidence for intrinsic charm by
exploiting a high-precision determination of the quark-gluon content of the
nucleon based on machine learning and a large experimental dataset. We
disentangle the intrinsic charm component from charm-anticharm pairs arising
from high-energy radiation. We establish the existence of intrinsic charm at
the 3-standard-deviation level, with a momentum distribution in remarkable
agreement with model predictions. We confirm these findings by comparing to
very recent data on Z-boson production with charm jets from the LHCb

contain five distinct types of diquarks; but in order to obtain reliable
results, it is sufficient to retain only isoscalar-scalar and
isovector-axialvector correlations, with the latter being especially important.
Viewed with low resolution, the Faddeev equation description of these states
bears some resemblance to the associated quark model pictures; namely, they
form a set of states related via orbital angular momentum excitation: the
negative parity states are primarily $\mathsf P$-wave in character, whereas the
positive parity states are $\mathsf D$ wave. However, a closer look reveals far
greater structural complexity than is typical of quark model descriptions, with
$\mathsf P$, $\mathsf D$, $\mathsf S$, $\mathsf F$ waves and interferences

proton-proton collisions decreases as final state particle multiplicity
increases. Moreover, the ALICE experiment at CERN has observed that the number
of deuterons produced increases with multiplicity, a behavior that is
qualitatively different from that of the $X(3872)$. These experimental findings
may point to a compact structure for the $X(3872)$ or, at least, that its
hadronization could proceed through a charm-anticharm core. We have recently
used a diffusion Monte Carlo method to solve the many-body Schr\""odinger
equation that describes the $X(3872)$ as a $c \bar c q \bar q$ tetraquark
system with quantum numbers $I^G(J^{PC})=0^+(1^{++})$ and $1^-(1^{++})$.
According to our structural analysis, the quark--(anti-)quark correlations
resemble light-meson--heavy-meson molecules of type $\omega J/\psi$ and $\rho
J/\psi$, rather than the most extended $D\bar D^{\ast}$ interpretation. It was
argued that this fact may be the key to make compatible the molecular features
of the $X(3872)$ with its production observables. The same formalism allows us
to compute the first color excited $c \bar c q \bar q$ tetraquark state with
either $I^G(J^{PC})=0^+(1^{++})$ or $1^-(1^{++})$. A bound-state is found in
each channel, their masses are around 4.0 GeV which is an energy region where
many new exotic candidates have been collected by the Particle Data Group.
Concerning their structural properties, these states cluster in a compact
diquark-antidiquark arrangement which matches perfectly with a so-called
Born-Oppenheimer tetraquark configuration. The promptly production rates of
these states in proton-proton, proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions
should fall off equal to or even faster than those of the $X(3872)$.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04221v1,[],[]

algebraic model describes meson's structure in terms of the spectral density

wave functions can be obtained algebraically from the corresponding parton
distribution amplitudes, whereas that is not the case for longitudinal
light-front wave functions, which requires an intermediate step where a
spectral density function must be derived from the particular parton
distribution amplitude; (ii) the derived spectral density functions show marked
differences between light and heavy vector mesons, the latter being narrower as
compared to the former; these are also non-positive definite, although the
integral over the entire curve is larger than zero as expected; and (iii) the
longitudinal and transverse light-front wave functions of vector mesons with
light quark content exhibit steep $x$- and $p_\perp^2$-dependence, while those
of the $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon(1S)$ mesons are characterized by narrow

Baryon Spin and Emergent Hadron Mass,['Peng Cheng'],2024-02-02T13:57:29Z,2024-02-02T13:57:29Z,"This thesis describes the use of Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs) to study
baryon bound states in QCD. In this work, octet baryon axial form factors are
calculated using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector $\times$ vector
contact interaction (SCI). The baryons are considered as
quark-plus-interacting-diquark bound states, whose structure (wave function) is
obtained by solving a Poincar\'e-covariant Faddeev equation. Since it preserves
symmetries, all consequences of partial conservation of the axial current are
manifest. For instance, one finds that octet baryon axial properties are
consistent with only minor violations of SU(3)-flavour symmetry, being
interpreted as a dynamical consequence of emergent hadron mass (EHM).
Considering neutral axial currents, the SCI delivers predictions for the
flavour separation of octet baryon axial charges and, consequently, produces
values for the associated SU(3) singlet, triplet, and octet axial charges. The
results indicate that, at the hadron scale $\zeta_{\mathcal{H}}$, valence
degrees of freedom carry approximately $50\%$ of an octet baryon's total spin.
Proton structure is one of the principal topics in hadron physics. Its study is
expected to reveal key features of both the origin of mass and strong
interaction dynamics. This work therefore extended the above analyses to an
examination of in-proton parton helicity (spin) distribution functions (DFs).
Using Ans\""atze for hadron-scale proton polarised valence quark DFs,
predictions are delivered for all proton polarised DFs at the measurement scale
$\zeta_{\rm C}^2 = 3\,$GeV$^2$. The pointwise behaviour of the predicted DFs
and, consequently, their moments, shows good agreement with results inferred

'sigma model' scenario which predicts the 2D Ising model universality class. In

this result is correct. We develop a physical picture for our results and
discuss the width of the scaling region (Ginzburg criterion), $1/N$

Gross-Neveu models. Lattices as large as $12 \times 72^2$ are simulated for
both the $N=12$ and $N=4$ cases and the numerical evidence for mean field
scaling is quite compelling. We point out that the amplitude ratio for the
model's susceptibility is a particulartly good observable for distinguishing
between the dimensional reduction and the mean field scenerios, because this
universal quantity differs by almost a factor of $20$ in the two cases. The
simulations are done close to the critical point in both the symmetric and
broken phases, and correlation lengths of order $10$ are measured. The critical
indices $\beta_{mag}$ and $\delta$ also pick out mean field behavior. We trace
the breakdown of the standard scenario (dimensional reduction and universality)
to the composite character of the mesons in the model. We point out that our

deviations from equilibrium, or on a sufficient homogeneity in time underlying
kinetic descriptions, are not applicable. A particular challenge is to connect
the far-from-equilibrium dynamics at early times with the approach to thermal
equilibrium at late times. Understanding the ``link'' between the early- and
the late-time behavior of quantum fields is crucial for a wide range of
phenomena. For the first time questions such as the explosive particle
production at the end of the inflationary universe, including the subsequent
process of thermalization, can be addressed in quantum field theory from first
principles. The progress in this field is based on efficient functional
integral techniques, so-called n-particle irreducible effective actions, for

implementing a dynamical renormalization group and using the hard thermal loop
(HTL) approximation. The focus is on the study of the relaxation of gauge and
fermionic mean fields and on the quantum kinetics of the photon and fermion
distribution functions. For semihard photons of momentum eT << k << T we find
to leading order in the HTL that the gauge mean field relaxes in time with a
power law as a result of infrared enhancement of the spectral density near the
Landau damping threshold. The dynamical renormalization group reveals the
emergence of detailed balance for microscopic time scales larger than 1/k while
the rates are still varying with time. The quantum kinetic equation for the
photon distribution function allows us to study photon production from a
thermalized quark-gluon plasma (QGP) by off-shell effects. We find that for a
QGP at temperature T ~ 200 MeV and of lifetime 10 < t < 50 fm/c the hard (k ~
T) photon production from off-shell bremsstrahlung (q -> q \gamma and \bar{q}
-> \bar{q}\gamma) at O(\alpha) grows logarithmically in time and is comparable
to that produced from on-shell Compton scattering and pair annihilation at
O(\alpha \alpha_s). Fermion mean fields relax as e^{-\alpha T t ln(\omega_P t)}
with \omega_P=eT/3 the plasma frequency, as a consequence of the emission and

regime arises in QCD, a stringy fluid, which is characterized by an approximate
chiral spin symmetry of the thermal partition function. This symmetry is not a
symmetry of the Dirac Lagrangian and is a symmetry of the electric part of the
QCD Lagrangian. In this regime the medium consists of the chirally symmetric
and approximately chiral spin symmetric hadrons that are made of the chirally
symmetric quarks connected into the color singlet compounds by a confining
chromoelectric field. This regime is evidenced by the approximate chiral spin
symmetry of the spatial and temporal correlators and by the breakdown of the
thermal perturbation theory at the crossover between the partonic (the
quark-gluon plasma) and stringy fluid regimes at ~ 3 T_{ch}. The chiral spin
symmetry smoothly disappears above ~ 3T_{ch} which means that the
chromoelectric confining interaction gets screened. A direct evidence that the
stringy fluid medium consists of densely packed hadrons is the pion spectral
function that shows a distinct pion state and its first radial excitation above
T_{ch}. Another direct evidence of the hadron degrees of freedom in the stringy
fluid is the bottomonium spectrum with the 1S,2S,3S and 1P,2P radial and
orbital excitations that become broad with temperature. The hadrons between
T_{ch} and ~ 3 T_{ch} in the stringy fluid interact strongly which makes the

contrary earlier we proposed a unified scenario for both GRBs-SGRs where a
precessing Gamma Jet (of different intensity) and its geometrical beaming is
the source of both GRB and SGRs wide morphology. GRBs are peaked SNs Jet
spinning and precessing observed along the thin Jet axis. Their mysterious weak
X precursors bursts, corresponding to non-negligible energy powers, up to

Comparable brief X-ray precursor flashes occurred in rarest and most detailed

of the surface composition of the sun. We examine the nuclear input on the
formation of solar 8B [S17(0)] and demonstrate that it is still quite uncertain

thus ill defined extrapolation to zero energy. This yields an additional
reasonably estimated uncertainty due to extrapolation of +0.0 -3.0 eV-b (+0%

theory used to extrapolate S17(0). This situation must be alleviated by new

radiation, emitted from the envelope, which is delayed by a time of order
hours. In addition, the electromagnetic radiation can be obscured by dust in
the intervening interstellar space. The question therefore arises whether a
supernova can be located by its neutrinos alone. The early warning of a
supernova and its location might allow greatly improved astronomical
observations. The theme of the present work is a careful and realistic
assessment of this question, taking into account the statistical significance
of the various neutrino signals. Not surprisingly, neutrino-electron forward
scattering leads to a good determination of the supernova direction, even in
the presence of the large and nearly isotropic background from other reactions.
Even with the most pessimistic background assumptions, SuperKamiokande (SK) and
the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) can restrict the supernova direction to
be within circles of radius $5^\circ$ and $20^\circ$, respectively. Other
reactions with more events but weaker angular dependence are much less useful

triangulation, i.e., determination of the supernova direction based on an

at higher energies. We also show that the behavior of the cross section and the
angular distribution can be well-understood analytically for $E_\nu \lesssim
60$ MeV by calculating to ${\cal O}(1/M)$, where $M$ is the nucleon mass. The
correct angular distribution is useful for separating $\bar{\nu}_e + p \to e^+
+ n$ events from other reactions and detector backgrounds, as well as for
possible localization of the source (e.g., a supernova) direction. We comment
on how similar corrections appear for the lepton angular distributions in the
deuteron breakup reactions $\bar{\nu}_e + d \to e^+ + n + n$ and $\nu_e + d \to
e^- + p + p$. Finally, in the reaction $\bar{\nu}_e + p \to e^+ + n$, the
angular distribution of the outgoing neutrons is strongly forward-peaked,
leading to a measurable separation in positron and neutron detection points,
also potentially useful for rejecting backgrounds or locating the source
direction.",http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9903554v1,['hep-ph'],['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']

standard femtoscopy model of random sources is inapplicable. The uncertainty
principle leads to the partial indistinguishability and coherence of closely

hydrodynamic model has led to the conclusion of very rapid thermalization. This
conclusion is based on the intuitive argument that hydrodynamics, which assumes
instantaneous local thermalization, produces the largest possible elliptic flow
values and that the data seem to saturate this limit. We here investigate the
question whether incompletely thermalized viscous systems may actually produce
more elliptic flow than ideal hydrodynamics. Motivated by the extremely fast
primordial longitudinal expansion of the reaction zone, we investigate a toy
model which exhibits thermalization only in the transverse directions but
undergoes collisionless free-streaming expansion in the longitudinal direction.
For collisions at RHIC energies, elliptic flow results from the model are
compared with those from hydrodynamics. With the final particle yield and
$\kt$-distribution fixed, the transversally thermalized model is shown not to
be able to produce the measured amount of elliptic flow. This investigation
provides further support for very rapid local kinetic equilibration at RHIC. It
also yields interesting novel results for the elliptic flow of massless

  Chapter 2 deals with QCD and its global symmetries in the chiral limit; the
concept of Green functions and Ward identities reflecting the underlying chiral
symmetry is elaborated.
  In Chap. 3 the idea of a spontaneous breakdown of a global symmetry is
discussed and its consequences in terms of the Goldstone theorem are
demonstrated.
  Chapter 4 deals with mesonic chiral perturbation theory and the principles
entering the construction of the chiral Lagrangian are outlined.
  Various examples with increasing chiral orders and complexity are given.
  Finally, in Chap. 5 the methods are extended to include the interaction
between Goldstone bosons and baryons in the single-baryon sector, with the main

operators, with the three-point correlator, being the first correlator with
non-trivial shape dependence, playing a special role in unravelling the

particles in the events and events in an ensemble of data. We identify power
counting rules and symmetries of minimum bias from which the form of the
squared matrix element can be expanded in symmetric polynomials of the phase
space coordinates. This expansion is entirely defined in terms of observable
quantities, in contrast to models of heavy ion collisions that rely on
unmeasurable quantities like the number of nucleons participating in the
collision, or tunes of parton shower parameters to describe the underlying
event in proton collisions. The expansion parameter that we identify from our
power counting is the number of detected particles $N$ and as $N\to\infty$ the
variance of the squared matrix element about its mean, constant value on phase
space vanishes. With this expansion, we show that the transverse momentum
distribution of particles takes a universal form that only depends on a single
parameter, has a fractional dispersion relation, and agrees with data in its
realm of validity. We show that the constraint of positivity of the squared
matrix element requires that all azimuthal correlations vanish in the
$N\to\infty$ limit at fixed center-of-mass energy, as observed in data. The
approach we follow allows for a unified treatment of small and large system
collective behavior, being equally applicable to describe, e.g., elliptic flow
in PbPb collisions and the ""ridge"" in pp collisions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04041v2,[],[]
"Application of the constituent quark exchange model to the parton
  distributions and the EMC ratios of $^{12}C$ and $^{14}N$ nuclei","['A. Hadian', 'M. Modarres']",2021-08-06T12:15:49Z,2021-08-06T12:15:49Z,"The quark exchange model (QEM) is reformulated for the $A=12$ and $14$
systems to obtain the constituent quark distributions of $^{12}C$ and $^{14}N$
nuclei, respectively. Afterwards, the different types of the point-like parton
distribution functions (PDFs), i.e., the valence quarks, the sea quarks and the
gluons, are extracted from the constituent quark model (CQM), at the hadronic
scale $Q_0^2=0.34$ $GeV^2$ to generate the constituent quark exchange model
(CQEM = QEM $\oplus$ CQM) PDFs. From the resulted PDFs, the structure functions
and the European Muon Collaboration (EMC) ratios of the above-mentioned nuclei
at the appropriate hadronic scale are calculated. To make our results more
comparable with the available experimental data, we evolve the PDFs, by using
the standard DGALP evolution equations, to the higher hard scales.
Subsequently, the EMC ratios of $^{12}C$ and $^{14}N$ nuclei at the some higher
energy scales, corresponding to the scales of available data, are calculated,
at the leading (LO) and the next-to-leading (NLO) orders of pQCD. By doing so,
it is observed that the EMC ratios do not significantly depend on the hard
scale $Q^2$, and the outcomes are consistent with the various experimental data
such as HERMES, BCDMS, JLab, SLAC, NMC, and EMC. Especially, in the mid-range
of Bjorken $x$ values, the results are so desirable. Like our previous works
for the $^4He$ and $^6Li$ nuclei, we again observe that at a fixed scale $Q^2$,
the LO and the NLO EMC ratios with high precision are approximately the same.
Therefore, one can conclude that at a given hard scale, the LO approximation is
good enough for calculating the EMC ratios of light nuclei.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03073v1,[],[]

production at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). In particular, we study
both spontaneous transverse $\Lambda$ polarization as well as the transverse

contribution from the TMD Polarizing Fragmentation Function (TMD PFF).
Similarly, we study the contribution of the transverse spin transfer
originating from the transversity TMD Fragmentation Function (TMD FF). We
provide projections for the statistical uncertainties in the corresponding spin
observables at the future EIC. Using these statistical uncertainties, we
characterize the role that the future EIC will play in constraining these

scattering process for spontaneous $\Lambda$ polarization with a proton beam.
We find that the projected experimental data leads to a significant decrease in
the uncertainties for the $u$ and sea TMD PFFs. Furthermore, to access the
impact of the EIC on the transversity TMD FF, we perform the first extraction
of the transversity TMD FF from the recent COMPASS data. We compare the
statistical uncertainties of the future EIC with the theoretical uncertainties

constitute the discovery of a matter-creating process, corroborating leading
theories of why the universe contains more matter than antimatter, and how
forces unify at high energy scales. It would also prove that neutrinos and
anti-neutrinos are not two distinct particles, but can transform into each
other, with their mass described by a unique mechanism conceived by Majorana.
The recognition that neutrinos are not massless necessitates an explanation and
has boosted interest in neutrinoless double-beta decay. The field stands now at
a turning point. A new round of experiments is currently being prepared for the
next decade to cover an important region of parameter space. In parallel,

substructure observables has been difficult. In this manuscript we expand on a
new approach to jet substructure in heavy-ion collisions based on the study of
correlation functions of energy flow operators (energy correlators). We compute
the two-point energy correlator of an in-medium massless quark jet and perform
a detailed numerical analysis of the produced spectra. Our calculation
incorporates vacuum radiation resummed at next-to-leading log accuracy together
with the leading order contribution in medium-induced splittings evaluated
through the BDMPS-Z multiple scattering and GLV single scattering formalisms
for a static brick of QGP. Our analysis demonstrates how particular features of
the modifications of in-medium splittings are imprinted in the correlator
spectra, particularly showing how energy correlators may be used to extract the
onset of colour coherence. We further present a comprehensive discussion on the
accuracy and limitations of our study emphasizing how it can be systematically
improved. This work sets the foundations for a rich program studying energy
correlators in heavy-ion collisions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03413v2,[],[]

general, the physics of axions is detailed by a quantum field theory of a real

characterize the mentioned axions in the low-energy regime. A possible
application of this equivalent description is to study the collapse of cold
dark matter into more complex structures. There have been a few derivations of
effective Lagrangians for the complex field $\psi$; resulting to be all

restoration of chiral symmetry. We demonstrate explicitly the quantum nature of

Model cannot be the ultimate theory of Nature, and e.g. cannot account for Dark
Matter or non-vanishing neutrino masses (and does not include gravity). In
fact, searches for physics beyond the SM have been intensified since the Higgs
boson discovery. In this article, we review the hints for new physics, called
``anomalies'', obtained in particle physics experiments within the last years.
We consider both direct high-energy searches for new resonances at the LHC and
indirect low-energy precision experiments. These anomalies range from the
nuclear scale (approximately the mass of the proton) to the electroweak scale
(i.e. the mass of the Higgs boson) to the TeV scale (the highest scale directly
accessible at the LHC), therefore spanning over four orders of magnitude. After
discussing the experimental and theoretical status of the anomalies, we

the dynamics of the condensate alone or the kinetics of the atoms). The
dynamics of the condensate squeezes and amplifies the quantum excitations,
mixing the positive and negative frequency components of their wave functions
thereby creating particles which appear as bursts and jets. By analyzing the
changing amplitude and particle content of these excitations, our simple
physical picture (based on a test field approximation) explains well the
overall features of the Bose Novae phenomena and provide excellent quantitative
fits with experimental data on several aspects, such as the scaling behavior of
the collapse time and the amount of particles in the jet. The predictions of
the bursts at this level of approximation is less than satisfactory but may be
improved on by including the backreaction of the excitations on the condensate.
The mechanism behind the dominant effect -- parametric amplification of vacuum
fluctuations and freezing of modes outside of horizon -- is similar to that of
cosmological particle creation and structure formation in a rapid quench (which
is fundamentally different from Hawking radiation in black holes). This shows
that BEC dynamics is a promising venue for doing `laboratory cosmology'.",http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0207289v3,['cond-mat'],['Condensed Matter']

predicted to collapse to a black hole, and a carbon rich star to a neutron

carbon/oxygen white dwarf and thus the initial stage of SNeIa. Since the triple
alpha-particle capture reaction, $^{8}Be(\alpha,\gamma)^{12}C$, the first

section of the $^{12}C(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}O$ reaction at the Gamow window (300

sufficiently high energies implies the phase transition to the quark--gluon
plasma. The key ingredient of our approach is the Hawking--Unruh effect: an
observer moving with an acceleration $a$ experiences the influence of a thermal
bath with an effective temperature $T = a / 2\pi$, similar to the one present
in the vicinity of a black hole horizon. For electric charges moving in
external electromagnetic fields of realistic strength, the resulting
temperature appears too small to be detected. However for partons in strong
color fields the effect should be observable: in the Color Glass Condensate
picture, the strength of the color-electric field is $E \sim Q_s^2/g$ ($Q_s$ is
the saturation scale, and $g$ is the strong coupling), the typical acceleration
is $a \sim Q_s$, and the heat bath temperature is $T = Q_s / 2\pi \sim 200$

a rapid thermalization over the time period of $\tau \simeq 2\pi/Q_s \simeq 1\
{\rm fm}$ accompanied by phase transitions. We consider a specific example of
chiral symmetry restoration induced by a rapid deceleration of the colliding

the ""most inviscid"" fluid known. Such low kinematic viscosity is believed to
reflect strongly correlated nature for QGP in these experiments. Hence, it may
provide a good example of a quantum fluid naturally suited to studies of
acoustic Hawking radiation. Due to rapid longitudinal expansion, presence of a
sonic horizon is also naturally guaranteed here, though, in general, this
horizon is not static. Using Ultra relativistic quantum molecular dynamics
(UrQMD) simulations, we show that, under certain conditions, the longitudinal
velocity of the plasma, near the sonic horizon, can become time independent for
a short span during the evolution of the system. During this period, we can
have a conformally static acoustic metric with a (conformal) Killing horizon
coinciding with the apparent horizon. An asymptotic observer will then see a
thermal flux of phonons, constituting the Hawking radiation, coming from the
horizon. For the relatively low energy collision considered here, where the
resulting QCD system is governed by non-relativistic hydrodynamics, we estimate
the Hawking temperature to be about 4-5 MeV (with the temperature of the QCD
fluid being about 135 MeV). We discuss the experimental signatures of this

imprints of coherent oscillations in the plot of $v_n^{rms}$ for sub-horizon

as the unversal force. All other forces then arise as these properties are
peeled off. For instance, relaxing (i) but retaining (ii) will lead to Maxwell
electromagnetic force. This unified outlook makes interesting suggestions and

Investigating the system at its critical temperature, we find that `strong'

mixing. Always at $T_c$, we argue that the two regimes are themselves separated
by a (second order) phase transition, with an order parameter given by the
fractional population difference between the two phases and a control parameter

pressure distributions in the hadrons, and they have been investigated by
generalized parton distributions (GPDs). The GPDs also contain information on
internal compositions of hadron spins. Understanding on the origin of hadron
masses, pressures, and spins is an important topic not only in hadron physics
but also as fundamental physics, and it should be clarified by the GPD studies.
The spacelike and timelike GPDs have been measured at charged-lepton
accelerator facilities, for example, by the virtual Compton scattering and the
two-photon process, respectively. In this work, we show the $\pi^\pm$ and
$\pi^0$ production cross sections in neutrino (antineutrino) reactions $\nu
\,(\bar\nu) + N \to \ell + \pi + N'$ for measuring the GPDs of the nucleon by
using the theoretical formalism of Pire, Szymanowski, and Wagner. The
$\pi^\pm$-production cross sections are useful for determining gluon GPDs,
whereas the $\pi^0$ production probes quark GPDs. In particular, we show the
roles of the pion- and rho-pole terms, the contribution from each GPD term
($H$, $E$, $\tilde H$, $\tilde E$), the effects of the gluon GPDs $H_g$ and
$E_g$, and the effects of the reaction energy on the neutrino cross sections.
The $\pi^0$-production cross section is sensitive to the quark GPDs including
the pion- and rho-pole GPD terms in the Efremov-Radyushkin-Brodsky-Lepage
region. These cross sections could be measured at Fermilab in future. The
neutrino GPD studies will play a complementary role to the projects of

unpolarized distribution functions for the nucleon and pion on the
valence-quark domain; namely, Bjorken-x \gtrsim 0.4. This domain is key to much
of hadron physics; e.g., a hadron is defined by its flavor content and that is
a valence-quark property. Furthermore, its accurate parametrization is crucial
to the provision of reliable input for large collider experiments. We focus on
experimental extractions of distribution functions via electron and muon
inelastic scattering, and from Drell-Yan interactions; and on theoretical
treatments that emphasize an explanation of the distribution functions,
providing an overview of major contemporary approaches and issues.
Valence-quark physics is a compelling subject, which probes at the heart of our
understanding of the Standard Model. There are numerous outstanding and
unresolved challenges, which experiment and theory must confront. In connection
with experiment, we explain that an upgraded Jefferson Lab facility is
well-suited to provide new data on the nucleon, while a future electron ion
collider could provide essential new data for the mesons. There is also great
potential in using Drell-Yan interactions, at FNAL, J-PARC and GSI, to push
into the large-x domain for both mesons and nucleons. We argue furthermore that
explanation, in contrast to modeling and parametrization, requires a widespread

e.m. interactions of baryons are typically described by hard form factors. In
contrasting this behaviour with that produced by a momentum-dependent
interaction, one achieves comparisons which highlight that elastic scattering
and resonance electroproduction experiments probe the infrared evolution of
QCD's running masses; e.g., the existence, and location if so, of a zero in the
ratio of nucleon Sachs form factors are strongly influenced by the running of
the dressed-quark mass. In our description of baryons, diquark correlations are
important. These correlations are instrumental in producing a zero in the Dirac
form factor of the proton's d-quark; and in determining d_v/u_v(x=1), as we
show via a formula that expresses d_v/u_v(x=1) in terms of the nucleon's
diquark content. The contact interaction produces a first excitation of the
nucleon that is constituted predominantly from axial-vector diquark
correlations. This impacts greatly on the gamma*p->P_{11}(1440) form factors.
Notably, our quark core contribution to F_2*(Q^2) exhibits a zero at
Q^2~0.5mN^2. Faddeev equation treatments of a hadron's quark core usually
underestimate its magnetic properties, hence we consider the effect produced by
a dressed-quark anomalous e.m. moment. Its inclusion much improves agreement

in making a realistic comparison between experiment and hadron structure

and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB), which is a remarkably effective
mass generating mechanism, responsible for the mass of more than 98% of visible

disappears as chiral symmetry is restored, one may argue that g_A vanishes with
the restoration of chiral symmetry because no nucleon bound-state survives the

explanation for a 25% reduction of g_A from its nonrelativistic quark-model

value relative to that obtained at leading-order in a widely used truncation of

Hence, given that the parameters which define extant simulations of

the form factors obtained therewith are a poor guide to properties of the

Amongst the results we describe, the following are of particular interest:
$G_E^p(Q^2)/G_M^p(Q^2)$ possesses a zero at $Q^2=9.5GeV^2$; any change in the
interaction which shifts a zero in the proton ratio to larger $Q^2$ relocates a
zero in $G_E^n(Q^2)/G_M^n(Q^2)$ to smaller $Q^2$; and there is likely a value
of momentum transfer above which $G_E^n>G_E^p$. Regarding the
$\Delta(1232)$-baryon, we find that, inter alia: the electric monopole form
factor exhibits a zero; the electric quadrupole form factor is negative, large
in magnitude, and sensitive to the nature and strength of correlations in the
$\Delta(1232)$ Faddeev amplitude; and the magnetic octupole form factor is
negative so long as rest-frame P- and D-wave correlations are included. In
connection with the N-to-Delta transition, the momentum-dependence of the

exemplified via the pion's valence dressed-quark GPD, $H_\pi^{\rm v}(x,\xi,t)$.
Our analysis focuses primarily on $\xi=0$, although we also capitalise on the
symmetry-preserving nature of the RL truncation by connecting $H_\pi^{\rm
v}(x,\xi=\pm 1,t)$ with the pion's valence-quark parton distribution amplitude.
We explain that the impulse-approximation used hitherto to define the pion's
valence dressed-quark GPD is generally invalid owing to omission of
contributions from the gluons which bind dressed-quarks into the pion. A simple
correction enables us to identify a practicable improvement to the
approximation for $H_\pi^{\rm v}(x,0,t)$, expressed as the Radon transform of a
single amplitude. Therewith we obtain results for $H_\pi^{\rm v}(x,0,t)$ and
the associated impact-parameter dependent distribution, $q_\pi^{\rm

Effects of kinematic cuts on net-electric charge fluctuations,"['Frithjof Karsch', 'Kenji Morita', 'Krzysztof Redlich']",2015-08-11T14:46:37Z,2016-02-16T03:14:52Z,"The effects of kinematic cuts on electric charge fluctuations in a gas of
charged particles are discussed. We consider a very transparent example of an
ideal pion gas with quantum statistics, which can be viewed as a
multi-component gas of Boltzmann particles with different charges and masses.
Cumulants of net-electric charge fluctuations $\chi_n^Q$ are calculated in a
static and expanding medium with flow parameters adjusted to the experimental
data. We show that the transverse momentum cut, $p_{t_\text{min}}\leq p_t\leq
p_{t_\text{max}}$, weakens the effects of Bose statistics, i.e. contributions
of effectively multi-charged states to higher order moments. Consequently, cuts
in $p_t$ modify the experimentally measured cumulants and their ratios. We
discuss the influence of kinematic cuts on the ratio of mean and variance of
electric charge fluctuations in a hadron resonance gas, in the light of recent
data of the STAR and PHENIX Collaborations. We find that the different momentum
cuts of $p_{t_\text{min}}=0.2$~GeV (STAR) and $p_{t_\text{min}}=0.3$~GeV
(PHENIX) are responsible for more than 30\% of the difference between these two
data sets. We argue that the $p_t$ cuts imposed on charged particles will
influence the normalized kurtosis {$\kappa_Q\sigma_Q^2 = \chi_4^Q/\chi_2^Q$} of
the electric charge fluctuations. In particular, the reduction of
$\kappa_Q\sigma_Q^2$ with increasing $p_{t_\text{min}}$ will lead to
differences between PHENIX and STAR data of ${\cal O}(6\%)$ which currently are
buried under large statistical and systematic errors. We furthermore introduce
the relation between momentum cut-off and finite volume effects, which is of

Poincar\'e-invariance in modern physics, the utility of a frame-dependent

Pion-nucleon scattering in the Roper channel from lattice QCD,"['C. B. Lang', 'L. Leskovec', 'M. Padmanath', 'S. Prelovsek']",2016-10-05T14:00:58Z,2017-01-31T11:36:38Z,"We present a lattice QCD study of $N\pi$ scattering in the positive-parity

experiment. The study is based on the PACS-CS ensemble of gauge configurations
with $N_f=2+1$ Wilson-clover dynamical fermions, $m_\pi \simeq 156~$MeV and
$L\simeq 2.9~$fm. In addition to a number of $qqq$ interpolating fields, we
implement operators for $N\pi$ in $p$-wave and $N\sigma$ in $s$-wave. In the
center-of-momentum frame we find three eigenstates below 1.65 GeV. They are
dominated by $N(0)$, $N(0)\pi(0)\pi(0)$ (mixed with $N(0)\sigma(0)$) and
$N(p)\pi(-p)$ with $p\simeq 2\pi/L$, where momenta are given in parentheses.
This is the first simulation where the expected multi-hadron states are found
in this channel. The experimental $N\pi$ phase-shift would -- in the
approximation of purely elastic $N\pi$ scattering -- imply an additional
eigenstate near the Roper mass $m_R\simeq 1.43~$GeV for our lattice size. We do
not observe any such additional eigenstate, which indicates that $N\pi$ elastic
scattering alone does not render a low-lying Roper. Coupling with other
channels, most notably with $N\pi\pi$, seems to be important for generating the
Roper resonance, reinforcing the notion that this state could be a dynamically
generated resonance. Our results are in line with most of previous lattice
studies based just on $qqq$ interpolators, that did not find a Roper eigenstate
below $1.65~$GeV. The study of the coupled-channel scattering including a
three-particle decay $N\pi\pi$ remains a challenge.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01422v2,[],[]

$P_{N^*}(E)$ of finding the bare state, $N^*$, in the $\pi N$ scattering states

information on the proton-to-Roper electroproduction transition form factors,
reaching $Q^2\approx 4.5\,$GeV$^2$. This scale probes the domain within which
hard valence-quark degrees-of-freedom could be expected to determine form
factor behavior. Hence, with this new data the Roper resonance becomes a
problem for strong-QCD [sQCD]. An explanation of how and where the Roper
resonance fits into the emerging spectrum of hadrons cannot rest on a
description of its mass alone. Instead, it must combine this with a detailed
understanding of the Roper's structure and how that is revealed in the
transition form factors. Furthermore, it must unify all this with a similarly
complete picture of the proton. This is a prodigious task, but a ten-year
international effort, drawing together experimentalists and theorists, has

first radial excitation, consisting of a dressed-quark core augmented by a
meson cloud that reduces the core mass by approximately 20% and materially

found that the PDA of a given scalar system possesses one more zero than that
of an analogous vector meson. Consequently, whereas the mean light-front
relative momentum of the valence-constituents within a vector meson is zero,
that within a scalar meson is large, an outcome which hints at a greater role

described by a very simple equation, especially if one considers just the

contemporary analyses; hence, calculations of $0^{-+}$ glueball properties
serve as a clear window onto the character and form of $V_{\mu\nu\rho}$. This
is important given that many modern calculations of $V_{\mu\nu\rho}$ predict
the appearance of an infrared suppression in the scalar function which comes to
modulate the bare vertex after the nonperturbative resummation of interactions.
Such behaviour is a peculiar prediction; but we find that such suppression is
essential if one is to achieve agreement with lattice-QCD predictions for the

implementation of the light-front quantization suffers from various subtleties
including the well-known zero-mode problem, the associated rapidity divergences
which mixes ultra-violet divergences with infrared physics, as well as breaking
of spatial rotational symmetry. We advocate that the light-front quantization
should be viewed as an effective theory in which small $k^+$ modes have been
effectively ``integrated out'', with an infinite number of renormalization
constants. Instead of solving light-front quantized field theories directly, we
make the large momentum expansion of the equal-time Euclidean correlation
functions in instant quantization as an effective way to systematically
calculate light-front correlations, including the light-front wave function
amplitudes. This large-momentum effective theory accomplishes an effective
light-front quantization through lattice QCD calculations. We demonstrate our

Problem of Lattice QCD. Due to the difficulty in calculating the higher order

larger values of $\mu_B$. Recently, a way to resum the contribution of the
first $N$ charge density correlation functions $D_1,\dots,D_N$ to the Taylor
series to all orders in $\mu_B$ was proposed in Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 2, 022001

the well-known cumulant expansion from statistics. By truncating the expansion

measured experimentally, are well reproduced by a hadron resonanse gas model at
temperatures below T_{ch} ~ 155 MeV and radically deviate from the hadron
resonance gas predictions above the chiral restoration crossover. This behavior
is typically interpreted as an indication of deconfinement in the quark-gluon
plasma regime. We present an argument that this interpretation may be too
simple. The argument is based on the scaling of quantities with the number of
colors: demonstration of deconfinement and QGP requires observable that is
sensitive to N_c^2 gluons while the conserved charges are sensitive only to
quarks and above T_{ch} scale as N_c^1. The latter scaling is consistent with
the existence of an intermediate regime characterized by restored chiral
symmetry and by approximate chiral spin symmetry which is a symmetry of
confining interaction. In this regime the energy density, pressure and entropy
density scale as N_c^1. In the large N_c limit this regime might become a
distinct phase separated from the hadron gas and from QGP by phase transitions.
A natural observable that associates with deconfinement and is directly
sensitive to deconfined N_c^2-1 gluons is the Polyakov loop; in the N_c=3 world

potential $\mu_B$ is an oft-used method to circumvent the well-known sign
problem of Lattice QCD. Owing to the associated difficulty and limitations of
precision in calculating these high-ordered Taylor coefficients, it becomes
essential to look for various resummation schemes which can mitigate the
computational cost, besides providing trustworthy estimates of different
thermodynamic observables. Recently, a way to exponentially resum the
contribution of the first $N$ charge density correlation functions
$D_1,\dots,D_N$ to the Taylor series to all orders in $\mu_B$ was proposed in
Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 2, 022001 (2022). Since the correlation functions $D_n$
are calculated stochastically using estimates from different random volume
sources, the resummation formulation gets affected by the biased estimates.
These estimates can become very drastic and can radically misdirect the
calculations for large values of $N$ and $\mu$ and also for observables which
are higher order $\mu$ derivatives of free energy, specially at lower
temperatures. In this work, we present a cumulant expansion procedure that
allows to investigate and regulate these biased estimates at different orders
in $\mu$. We find that the unbiased estimates in the cumulant expansion can
truly capture the genuine higher-order stochastic fluctuations of the higher
order correlation functions, which got suppressed by the exponential
resummation formulation. Finally, we discover an unbiased formalism of the
exponential resummation, which when expanded in a series, can exactly reproduce
the Taylor series upto a desired power in $\mu$. We are also able to regain the
knowledge of reweighting factor and many other important properties of the
partition function, which got entirely lost through the implementation of
cumulant expansion scheme.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07241v2,[],[]

on hard exclusive scattering processes in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at high
energies, while the second part delves into spin phenomena at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC).
  Hard exclusive scattering processes play a crucial role in QCD at high
energies, providing unique insights into the confined partonic dynamics within
hadrons, complementing inclusive processes. Studying these processes within the
QCD factorization approach yields the generalized parton distribution (GPD), a
nonperturbative parton correlation function that offers a three-dimensional
tomographic parton image within a hadron. However, the experimental measurement
of these processes poses significant challenges. This thesis will review the
factorization formalism for related processes, examine the limitations of some
widely used processes, and introduce two novel processes that enhance the
sensitivity to GPD, particularly its dependence on the parton momentum fraction
$x$.
  The second part of the thesis centers on spin phenomena, specifically single
spin production, at the LHC. Noting that a single transverse polarization can
be generated even in an unpolarized collision, this research proposes two new
jet substructure observables: one for boosted top quark jets and another for
high-energy gluon jets. The observation of these phenomena paves the way for
innovative tools in LHC phenomenology, enabling both precision measurements and

fluctuations on efficiency correction for cumulant analysis in relativistic
heavy-ion collision experiments. Experimentally, particle efficiencies of
events measured under different experimental conditions should be different.
For fluctuation measurements, the final event-by-event multiplicity
distributions should be the superposed distributions of various type of events
measured under different conditions. We demonstrate efficiency fluctuation
effects using numerical simulation, in which we construct an event ensemble
consisting of events with two different efficiencies. By using the mean
particle efficiencies, we find that the efficiency corrected cumulants show
large deviations from the original inputs when the discrepancy between the two
efficiencies is large. We further studied the effects of efficiency
fluctuations for the cumulants of net-proton distributions by implementing the
UrQMD events of Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7$ GeV in a realistic STAR
detector acceptance. We consider the unequal efficiency in two sides of the
Time Projection Chamber (TPC), multiplicity dependent efficiency, and the
event-by-event variations of the collision vertex position along the
longitudinal direction ($V_\mathrm{z}$). When the efficiencies fluctuate
dramatically within the studied event sample, the effects of efficiency
fluctuations have significant impacts on the efficiency corrections of
cumulants with the mean efficiency. We find that this effect can be effectively
suppressed by binning the entire event ensemble into various sub-event samples,
in which the efficiency variations are relatively small. The final efficiency
corrected cumulants can be calculated from the weighted average of the

interesting challenges faced by gauge theories like Quantum Electrodynamics and
Quantum Chromodynamics. This is particularly challenging since all QED
textbooks state that such an splitting cannot be done for a photon (and a
fortiori for a gluon) in a gauge-invariant way, yet experimentalists around the
world are engaged in measuring what they believe is the gluon spin! This
question has been a subject of intense debate and controversy, ever since, in
2008, it was claimed that such a gauge-invariant split was, in fact, possible.
We explain in what sense this claim is true and how it turns out that one of
the main problems is that such a decomposition is not unique and therefore
raises the question of what is the most natural or physical choice. The
essential requirement of measurability does not solve the ambiguities and leads
us to the conclusion that the choice of a particular decomposition is
essentially a matter of taste and convenience. In this review, we provide a
pedagogical introduction to the question of angular momentum decomposition in a

new system of electromagnetic units, based on meter, kilogram, and second,
bearing on these findings. The system has none of the disadvantages of
traditional three-unit systems. On the basis of our theoretical model we can
genuinely derive the scaling factor between electromagnetic and mechanic
variables, which is equal, within a few percent, to Planck's constant h. The

was cherished by Einstein). This M->0 state would materialize after the body
radiates its entire initial mass-energy. Thus there is no event horizon at any

classical system is chaotic, and essentially states that the energy
eigenfunctions behave as if they were gaussian random variables. We review the
existing evidence, and show that previously neglected effects substantially
strengthen the case for Berry's conjecture. We study a rarefied hard-sphere gas
as an explicit example of a many-body system which is known to be classically
chaotic, and show that an energy eigenstate which obeys Berry's conjecture
predicts a Maxwell--Boltzmann, Bose--Einstein, or Fermi--Dirac distribution for
the momentum of each constituent particle, depending on whether the wave
functions are taken to be nonsymmetric, completely symmetric, or completely
antisymmetric functions of the positions of the particles. We call this
phenomenon {\it eigenstate thermalization}. We show that a generic initial
state will approach thermal equilibrium at least as fast as
$O(\hbar/\Delta)t^{-1}$, where $\Delta$ is the uncertainty in the total energy

to search for black hole signatures. Black hole production in the scattering of
ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos on nucleons in the atmosphere may initiate
quasi-horizontal air showers far above the Standard Model rate. In this letter,
we compare the sensitivity of LHC and Auger to black hole production by
studying their respective reach in black hole production parameter space.

that if the ultrahigh energy neutrino flux is at the level expected from cosmic

a small window of opportunity to detect black holes before the start of the

realized in nature, then the first signs of black hole production may be

from the atom, leaving behind a perturbed ""hollow ion"" whose relaxation may
take different routes. In light elements, emission of an Auger electron is
common. However, the energy and the total number of electrons released from the
atom may be modulated by shake-up and shake-off effects. When the inner-shell
electron leaves, the outer-shell electrons may find themselves in a state that
is not an eigen-state of the atom in its surroundings. The resulting collective
excitation is called shake-up. If this process also involves the release of low
energy electrons from the outer shell, then the process is called shake-off. It
is not clear how significant shake-up and shake-off contributions are to the
overall ionisation of biological materials like proteins. In particular, the
interaction between the out-going electron and the remaining system depends on
the chemical environment of the atom, which can be studied by quantum chemical
methods. Here we present calculations on model compounds to represent the most
common chemical environments in proteins. The results show that the shake-up
and shake-off processes affect about 20% of all emissions from nitrogen, 30%
from carbon, 40% from oxygen, and 23% from sulphur. Triple and higher
ionisations are rare for carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, but are frequent for
sulphur. The findings are relevant to the design of biological experiments at

The first second of the Universe,['Dominik J. Schwarz'],2003-03-26T15:12:56Z,2003-05-16T12:37:31Z,"The history of the Universe after its first second is now tested by high
quality observations of light element abundances and temperature anisotropies
of the cosmic microwave background. The epoch of the first second itself has
not been tested directly yet; however, it is constrained by experiments at
particle and heavy ion accelerators. Here I attempt to describe the epoch
between the electroweak transition and the primordial nucleosynthesis.
  The most dramatic event in that era is the quark--hadron transition at 10
$\mu$s. Quarks and gluons condense to form a gas of nucleons and light mesons,
the latter decay subsequently. At the end of the first second, neutrinos and
neutrons decouple from the radiation fluid. The quark--hadron transition and
dissipative processes during the first second prepare the initial conditions
for the synthesis of the first nuclei.
  As for the cold dark matter (CDM), WIMPs (weakly interacting massive
particles) -- the most popular candidates for the CDM -- decouple from the
presently known forms of matter, chemically (freeze-out) at 10 ns and
kinetically at 1 ms. The chemical decoupling fixes their present abundances and
dissipative processes during and after thermal decoupling set the scale for the

Gravitationally induced electromagnetism at the Compton scale,['Kjell Rosquist'],2004-12-14T13:32:04Z,2006-04-10T13:32:52Z,"It is shown that Einstein gravity tends to modify the electric and magnetic
fields appreciably at distances of the order of the Compton wavelength. At that
distance the gravitational field becomes spin dominated rather than mass
dominated. The gravitational field couples to the electromagnetic field via the
Einstein-Maxwell equations which in the simplest model causes the electrostatic
field of charged spinning particles to acquire an oblate structure relative to
the spin direction. For electrons and protons, a pure Coulomb field is
therefore likely to be incompatible with general relativity at the Compton
scale. In the simplest model, the magnetic dipole corresponds to the Dirac
g-factor, g=2. Also, it follows from the form of the electric field that the
electric dipole moment vanishes, in agreement with current experimental limits
for the electron. Quantitatively, the classical Einstein-Maxwell theory
predicts the magnetic and electric dipoles of the electron to an accuracy of
about one part in 10^{-3} or better. Going to the next multipole order, one
finds that the first non-vanishing higher multipole is the electric quadrupole
moment which is predicted to be -124 barn for the electron. Any non-zero value
of the electric quadrupole moment for the electron or the proton would be a
clear sign of curvature due to the implied violation of rotation invariance.
There is also a possible spherical modification of the Coulomb force
proportional to r^{-4}. However, the size of this effect is well below current
experimental limits. The corrections to the hydrogen spectrum are expected to
be small but possibly detectable.",http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0412064v3,['gr-qc'],['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology']

broken symmetry phases of scalar theory in the nonlinear regime for large
initial energy densities, and after linear unstabilities (parametric or
spinodal) are shut-off by the quantum backreaction. A new time scale emerges
that separates the linear from the non-linear regimes. This scale is non-
perturbative in the coupling and initial amplitude. The non-perturbative
evolution is studied in the large the N limit for the O(N) vector model. A
combination of numerical analysis and the multitime scale analysis reveals the
presence of unstable bands in the nonlinear regime. These are associated with
power law growth of quantum fluctuations, that result in power law relaxation

exponents.We find substantial particle production during this non-linear evolu-

value of the scalar field vanishes asymptotically transferring all of the
initial energy into produced particles via the non-linear resonances in the
unbroken symmetry phase.The effective mass for the quantum modes tends asympto-

power behaviour in the modes which become free for t=infty. We derive a simple
expression for the equation of state for the fluid of produced particles that
interpolates between radiation-type and dust-type equations according to the

behavior of QCD in extreme conditions of high temperature or large baryon
number density. Among the highlights are the prediction of a well-characterized
true critical point, and the discovery that the ground state of three-flavor
QCD at asymptotically high densities exhibits color-flavor locking. The
critical point occurs at the unique temperature and density where a sharp
distinction between an ionized plasma of quarks and gluons and the hadronic
phase first appears. It appears to be accessible both to numerical and to
laboratory experiments. Color-flavor locking provides a calculable,
weak-coupling realization of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. It also
provides a microscopic realization of Han-Nambu charge assignments for quark
quasiparticles, and of Yang-Mills theory for the physical vector mesons. Here I

been measured with modest precision. Their precise magnitude remains model
dependent due to the contributions of the background amplitudes, although rapid
progress is being made to reduce these uncertainties. A discussion of what is
required to perform a model independent analysis is presented. All of the data
to date are consistent with a prolate shape for the proton (larger at the
poles) and an oblate shape(flatter at the poles) for the Delta. It is suggested
here that the fundamental reason for this lies in the spontaneous breaking of
chiral symmetry in QCD and the resulting, long range(low Q^2), effects of the

it uses the real-time evolution of parton cascades in conjunction with a
self-consistent hadronization scheme that is governed by the dynamics itself.
The causal evolution from a specific initial state (determined by the colliding
beam particles) is followed by the time-development of the phase-space
densities of partons, pre-hadronic parton clusters, and final-state hadrons, in
position-space, momentum-space and color-space. The parton-evolution is

momentum-space description of multipl (semi) hard interactions in QCD,
involving 2 -> 2 parton collisions, 2 -> 1 parton fusion processes, and 1 -> 2
radiation processes. The formation of color-singlet pre-hadronic clusters and
their decays into hadrons, on the other hand, is treated by using a spatial
criterion motivated by confinement and a non-perturbative model for
hadronization. This article gives a brief review of the physics underlying VNI,

configuration is not identical to the so-called disoriented chiral condensate

realistic picture is that of an ``unpolarized'' DCC, where the Fourier modes of
the field have completely independent orientations in isospin space instead of

implications concerning the possible detection of the phenomenon. In
particular, the main expected signature of the original DCC, which is used in
most experimental searches, is absent in the unpolarized case. We point out
that the fact that no evidence of DCC formation has been reported so far in
nuclear collisions actually agrees with our present theoretical understanding.
New experimental strategies should be designed to look for the unpolarized DCC

Are direct photons a clean signal of a thermalized quark gluon plasma?,"['D. Boyanovsky', 'H. J. de Vega']",2003-05-20T18:28:54Z,2003-07-29T22:36:10Z,"Direct photon production from a quark gluon plasma (QGP) in thermal
equilibrium is studied directly in real time. In contrast to the usual S-matrix
calculations, the real time approach is valid for a QGP that formed and reached
LTE a short time after a collision and of finite lifetime ($\sim 10-20
\mathrm{fm}/c$ as expected at RHIC or LHC). We point out that during such
finite QGP lifetime the spectrum of emitted photons carries information on the
initial state. There is an inherent ambiguity in separating the virtual from
the observable photons during the transient evolution of the QGP. We propose a
real time formulation to extract the photon yield which includes the initial
stage of formation of the QGP parametrized by an effective time scale of
formation $\Gamma^{-1}$. This formulation coincides with the S-matrix approach
in the infinite lifetime limit. It allows to separate the virtual cloud as well
as the observable photons emitted during the pre- equilibrium stage from the
yield during the QGP lifetime. We find that the lowest order contribution
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{em})$ which does \emph{not} contribute to the S-matrix
approach, is of the same order of or larger than the S-matrix contribution
during the lifetime of the QGP for a typical formation time $\sim 1
\mathrm{fm}/c$. The yield for momenta $\gtrsim 3 \mathrm{Gev}/c$ features a
power law fall-off $\sim T^3 \Gamma^2/k^{5}$ and is larger than that obtained
with the S-matrix for momenta $\geq 4 \mathrm{Gev}/c$. We provide a
comprehensive numerical comparison between the real time and S-matrix yields
and study the dynamics of the build-up of the photon cloud and the different
contributions to the radiative energy loss. The reliability of the current

viability of this model by focusing on the decay width of the nucleon members

means of exotic commutator method. The hypothesis of vanishing of the exotic
commutators leads to the system of master equations (ME). Solvability
conditions of these equations define relations between the complex masses of
the nonet and decuplet mesons which, in turn, determine relations between the
real masses (mass formulae), as well as between the masses and widths of the
mesons. Mass formulae are independent of the particle widths. The masses of the
nonet and decuplet particles obey simple ordering rules. The nonet mixing angle
and the mixing matrix of the isoscalar states of the decuplet are completely
determined by solution of ME; they are real and do not depend on the widths.
All known scalar mesons with the mass smaller than $2000MeV$ (excluding

scaling describes the reduction of hadronic masses in matter and at finite

experimental data presented at the Quark Matter Conference is not correct and
that Brown-Rho scaling is valid. To make this argument we discuss the evolution
in time of the excited hadronic system and suggest that the system is
deconfined at the earliest times and becomes confined when the density and
temperature decrease as the system evolves. Thus, we suggest that we see both
the properties of the deconfined and confined systems in the experimental data.

suggested that chiral symmetry is approximately restored in excited hadrons at
zero temperature/density (effective symmetry restoration). If correct, this
implies that mass generation mechanisms and physics in excited hadrons is very
different as compared to the lowest states. One needs an alternative and
independent experimental information to confirm this conjecture. Using very
general chiral symmetry arguments it is shown that strict chiral restoration in
a given excited nucleon forbids its decay into the N \pi channel. Hence those
excited nucleons which are assumed from the spectroscopic patterns to be in
approximate chiral multiplets must only ""weakly"" decay into the N \pi channel,
(f_{N^*N\pi}/f_{NN\pi})^2 << 1. However, those baryons which have no chiral
partner must decay strongly with a decay constant comparable with f_{NN\pi}.
Decay constants can be extracted from the existing decay widths and branching
ratios. It turnes out that for all those well established excited nucleons

established excited nucleon for which the chiral partner cannot be identified
from the spectroscopic data, N(1520), has a decay constant into the N\pi

statistical model of particle production in heavy ion collisions, using $K/\pi$
fluctuations as an example. We define an observable capable of determining
which statistical model, if any, governs freeze-out in ultrarelativistic heavy
ion collisions. We calculate this observable for $K/\pi$ fluctuations, and show
that it should be the same for RHIC and LHC energies, as well as independent of
centrality, if the Grand-Canonical statistical model is an appropriate
description and chemical equilibrium applies. We describe variations of this
scaling for deviations from this scenario, such as light quark chemical
non-equilibrium, strange quark over-saturation and local conservation
(canonical ensemble) for strange quarks. We also introduce a similar observable

interacting hadron gas phase governs the system between thermal and chemical

main steps: the photon knocks the quark from one of the nucleons in the
deuteron; the struck quark rescatters off a quark from the other nucleon
sharing the high energy of the photon; then the energetic quarks recombine into
two outgoing baryons which have large transverse momenta. Within the HRM, the
cross section is expressed through the amplitude of $pn\rightarrow
\Delta\Delta$ scattering which we evaluated based on the quark-interchange
model of hard hadronic scattering. Calculations show that the angular
distribution and the strength of the photodisintegration is mainly determined
by the properties of the

the deuteron breakup to $ \Delta^{++}\Delta^{-}$ is 4-5 times larger than that
of the breakup to the $ \Delta^{+}\Delta^{0}$ channel. Also, the angular
distributions for these two channels are markedly different. These can be
compared with the predictions based on the assumption that two hard
$\Delta$-isobars are the result of the disintegration of the preexisting

antisymmetrized (or fermionic) molecular dynamics (AMD) and also in a simple
shell model for comparison. According to the AMD, the Be-9 nucleus consists of
two alpha-like clusters with a surrounding neutron. The clustering produces
high-momentum components in nuclear wave functions, which affects nuclear
modifications of the structure functions. We investigated whether clustering
features could appear in the structure function F_2 of Be-9 along with studies
for other light nuclei. We found that nuclear modifications of F_2 are similar
in both AMD and shell models within our simple convolution description although
there are slight differences in Be-9. It indicates that the anomalous Be-9
result should be explained by a different mechanism from the nuclear binding
and Fermi motion. If nuclear-modification slopes d(F_2^A/F_2^D)/dx are shown by
the maximum local densities, the Be-9 anomaly can be explained by the AMD
picture, namely by the clustering structure, whereas it certainly cannot be
described in the simple shell model. This fact suggests that the large nuclear
modification in Be-9 should be explained by large densities in the clusters.
For example, internal nucleon structure could be modified in the high-density
clusters. The clustering aspect of nuclear structure functions is an unexplored

Such clustering aspects are studied by using antisymmetrized molecular dynamics

to have a quadruplet Higgs field to produce the Dirac mass terms to facilitate
the seesaw mechanism. The vacuum expectation value of the quadruplet Higgs is

nuclei in hard scattering reactions. Through these processes, this work
explored the constituent structure of baryons and the mechanisms through which
the interactions between these constituents ultimately control the selected
reactions. First, hard nucleon-nucleon elastic scattering was studied
considering the quark exchange (QE) between the nucleons to be the dominant
mechanism of interaction in the constituent picture. It was found that an
angular asymmetry exhibited by proton-neutron (pn) elastic scattering data is
explained within this framework if a quark-diquark picture dominates the
nucleon's structure instead of a more traditional SU(6) model. The latter
yields an asymmetry around 90 deg center of mass scattering with a sign
opposite to what is experimentally observed. The second process is the hard
breakup by a photon of a nucleon-nucleon system in light nuclei. Proton-proton
(pp) and pn breakup in 3He, and double Delta-isobars production in deuteron
breakup were analyzed in the hard rescattering model (HRM), which in
conjunction with the QE mechanism provides a QCD description of the reaction.
Cross sections for both channels in 3He photodisintegration were computed
without the need of a fitting parameter. The results presented here for pp
breakup show excellent agreement with recent experimental data. In double
Delta-isobars production in deuteron breakup, HRM angular distributions for the
two double Delta channels were compared to the pn channel and to each other. An
important prediction from this study is that the Delta++ Delta- channel
consistently dominates Delta+Delta0, which is in contrast with models that
unlike the HRM consider a double Delta system in the initial state of the

to the turning off of deconfinement by testing the hypothesis that
hydrodynamics and parton coalescence always apply, but are obscured, at lower
energies, by variations in the widths of quark and anti-quark rapidity
distribution. We find that this effect is enough to spoil quark number scaling
in elliptic flow. A lack of scaling in data therefore does not signal the
absence of partonic degrees of freedom and hadronization by coalescence. In a
coalescing partonic fluid, however, elliptic flow of anti-baryons should be the
greater than that of baryons, since antibaryons contain a greater admixture of
partons from the highly flowing midrapidity region. Intriguingly, purely
hadronic dynamics has a similar dependence of baryon-anti-baryons $v_2$ as
purely partonic dynamics, again because antibaryons tend to come from regions
where the deviation of the system from hydrodynamic behavior is at its

elements: (a) A correlation between jet production and \pp centrality is
suggested by the transverse partonic structure of hadrons inferred from
deep-inelastic scattering data. (b) The {\em underlying event} (UE) is defined
as the final-state particles complementary to a triggered high-energy dijet. An
observable common to both topics is variation of so-called {\em transverse
multiplicity} $N_\perp$ with a $p_{t,trig}$ dijet trigger. We test assumptions
associated with \pp collision centrality and the UE. We determine the nature of
the UE and explore the relation between jet production and \pp centrality. We
use the {\em two-component model} (TCM) of spectra and correlations derived
from 200 GeV \pp collisions to construct a simulated particle distribution on
$(p_t,n_{ch})$ to predict the $N_\perp$ response to $p_{t,trig}$. The $p_t$
spectrum TCM combined in this analysis with measured minimum-bias \pp angular
correlations suggests that the UE includes a substantial contribution from the
triggered dijet in addition to the contribution from projectile fragmentation
(beam-beam remnants). The jet contribution to $N_\perp$ may represent a
universal large-angle base common to all dijets that extends across $2\pi$
azimuth. The analysis further suggests that \pp centrality is not controlled
significantly by $p_{t,trig}$ but may be correlated to some extent with an
imposed $n_{ch}$ condition, depending on the role of fluctuations. Future
correlation studies may better determine the role of \pp centrality. These
results may have implications for ongoing RHIC analysis and LHC searches for

dijet asymmetry and azimuthal distributions. We consider two different
background subtraction methods, an area-based one implemented through the
FastJet pack- age and a pedestal subtraction method, that resemble the ones

influence of quenching using Q-PYTHIA on the dijet observables with the
different background subtrac- tion methods and, additionally, we examine the
missing momentum of particles. The average background level and fluctuations
affect both single inclusive spectra and dijet asymmetries, although
differently for different subtraction setups. A large azimuthal modulation of
the background has a visible effect on the azimuthal dijet distributions.

experiments within the standard model with massive Majorana neutrinos. Using
Bayesian inference makes it possible to take into account the theoretical
uncertainties on the nuclear matrix elements in a fully consistent way. First,
we analyze the data used to claim the observation of neutrinoless double beta
decay in Ge-76, and find strong evidence (according to Jeffrey's scale) for a
peak in the spectrum and moderate evidence for that the peak is actually close
to the energy expected for the neutrinoless decay. We also find a significantly
larger statistical error than the original analysis, which we include in the
comparison with other data. Then, we statistically test the consistency between
this claim with that of recent measurements using Xe-136. We find that the two
data sets are about 40 to 80 times more probable under the assumption that they
are inconsistent, depending on the nuclear matrix element uncertainties and the
prior on the smallest neutrino mass. Hence, there is moderate to strong
evidence of incompatibility, and for equal prior probabilities the posterior
probability of compatibility is between 1.3% and 2.5%. If one, despite such
evidence for incompatibility, combines the two data sets, we find that the
total evidence of neutrinoless double beta decay is negligible. If one ignores
the claim, there is weak evidence against the existence of the decay. We also
perform approximate frequentist tests of compatibility for fixed ratios of the
nuclear matrix elements, as well as of the no signal hypothesis. Generalization

an overview of low energy experimental tests of ChPT predictions of $\pi\pi$

production. These predictions have been shown to be consistent with QCD in the
meson sector by increasingly accurate lattice calculations. At present there is
good agreement between experiment and ChPT calculations, including the $\pi\pi$

accurate pionic atom data are in agreement with chiral calculations once
isospin breaking effects due to the mass difference of the up and down quarks

inclusion of the heavy neutrino contributions, arising naturally in TeV-scale

these processes are carefully analyzed. We find that: (i) In the
$K^-p\rightarrow \Sigma^0\pi^0$ process, both $\Lambda(1405)S_{01}$ and
$\Lambda(1520)D_{03}$ play dominant roles. Significant contributions of
$\Lambda(1670)S_{01}$ and $\Lambda(1690)D_{03}$ could be seen around their
threshold; (ii) In the $K^-p\rightarrow \Lambda\pi^0$ process, some obvious
evidence of $\Sigma(1775)D_{15}$ and $\Sigma(1750)S_{11}$ could be found. Some
hints of $\Sigma(1620)S_{11}$ might exist in the reaction as well.
$\Sigma(1750)S_{11}$ and $\Sigma(1620)S_{11}$ should correspond to the
representations $[70,^48]S_{11}$ and $[70,^28]S_{11}$, respectively; (iii) In
the $K^-p\rightarrow \bar{K}^0n$ process, the dominant resonances are
$\Lambda(1405)$ and $\Lambda(1520)$. Some evidence of $\Lambda(1690)D_{03}$,
$\Sigma(1670)D_{13}$ and $\Sigma(1775)D_{15}$ could be seen as well. A weak
coupling of $\Lambda(1670)S_{01}$ to $\bar{K}N$ should be needed in the

information about the underlying particle production mechanism. The ALICE

smaller than in p+p and p+Pb collisions. Other interesting features of data is
rather flatness of <p_T> at high N_{ch} in Pb+Pb and p+Pb collisions in
seemingly striking contrast to the case of p+p collisions. With a detailed
calculation, we show all these peculiar features in a wide range of energies

the Color Glass Condensate framework using the k_T-factorization. This
establishes an important fact that the bulk of the produced particles in

provide a strong evidence in favor of geometric-scaling phenomenon and gluon

the coefficients of the effective theory, through which one can characterize
the low-energy consequences of arbitrary ultraviolet theories of WIMP
interactions; and 2) one-body density matrices for commonly used targets, the

theorists to update the script as new calculations become available,
independent of specific particle-physics contexts. The Mathematica package
outputs the resulting response functions (and associated form factors) and also
the differential event rate, once a galactic WIMP velocity profile is

prove sensitive to the nuclear modifications of the gluon distributions, the
corresponding uncertainties clearly exceeding the estimated baseline

This procedure is however time consuming and technically challenging, and
moreover can only be performed by the PDF fitters themselves. In the case of

inference to propagate the effects of new data into the PDFs without the need

interaction between spectator charges and final state pions results in charge
splitting of positive and negative pion directed flow. Such a charge splitting
is visible in the experimental data reported by the STAR Collaboration.
  The magnitude of this charge splitting appears to strongly depend on the
actual distance between the pion emission site (pion at freeze-out) and the
spectator system. As such, the above electromagnetic effect brings new,
independent information on the space-time evolution of pion production in heavy
ion collisions.
  From the comparison of our present analysis to our earlier studies made for
pions produced at higher rapidity, we formulate conclusions on the rapidity
dependence of the distance between the pion emission site and the spectator
system. This distance appears to decrease with increasing pion rapidity,
reflecting the longitudinal expansion of the strongly-interacting system
responsible for pion emission. Thus for the first time, information on the
space-time characteristics of the system is being provided by means of the
spectator-induced electromagnetic interaction.
  The above electromagnetic effect being in fact a straight-forward consequence
of the presence of spectator charges in the collision, we consider that it

constituent quark picture together with Landau relativistic hydrodynamics and
shown to interrelate the measurements from different types of collisions.
Within this picture, the dependence on the number of participants in heavy-ion

defined as a centrality-dependent fraction of the collision energy. The
effective energy approach is shown to reveal a similarity in the energy

Highlights from COMPASS in hadron spectroscopy,['Fabian Krinner'],2014-12-31T13:24:34Z,2014-12-31T13:24:34Z,"Since Quantum Choromdynamics allows for gluon self-coupling, quarks and
gluons cannot be observed as free particles, but only their bound states, the
hadrons. This so-called confinement phenomenon is responsible for $98\%$ of the
mass in the visible universe. The measurement of the hadron excitation spectra
therefore gives valuable input for theory and phenomenology to quantitatively
understand this phenomenon. One simple model to describe hadrons is the
Constituent Quark Model (CQM), which knows two types of hadrons: mesons,
consisting of a quark and an antiquark, and baryons, which are made out of
three quarks. More advanced models, which are inspired by QCD as well as
calculations within Lattice QCD predict the existence of other types of
hadrons, which may be e.g. described solely by gluonic excitations (glueballs)
or mixed quark and gluon excitations (hybrids). In order to search for such
states, the COMPASS experiment at the Super Proton Synchrotron at CERN has
collected large data sets, which allow to study the light-quark meson and
baryon spectra in unmatched precision. The overview shown here focuses on the
light meson sector, presenting a detailed Partial-Wave Analysis of the

with $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ is observed. A resonant origin of this signal would not be

sections and compare predictions for pion-production with available data.
[Method] The Giessen Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) model is used for
the description of all incohrent channels in neutrino-nucleus reactions.
[Results] Differential cross sections for charged and neutral pion production

the pion kinetic energy spectra significantly. The data for charged pion
production at MINER$\nu$A are compatible with the results of calculations using
elementary data taken from an old Argonne National Laboratory experiment.
Remaining differences can be attributed to coherent production; the data for
antineutrino induced neutral pion production, where no coherent contribution is

neutral pseudoscalar mesons off neutrons from deuteron data. The main statement
is that the final-state interaction (FSI) corrections for the proton and
neutron target are in general not equal, but for pi0 production there are
special cases were they have to be identical and there are large regions in the
parameter space of incident photon energy and pion polar angle, \theta^*, where
they happen to be quite similar. The corrections for both target nucleons are
practically identical for $\pi_0$ production in the energy range of the
Delta(1232)3/2+ resonance due to the specific isospin structure of this
excitation. Also above the $\Delta$-isobar range large differences between
proton and neutron correction factors are only predicted for extreme forward
angles ($\theta^*$ < 20 deg), but the results are similar for larger angles.

based on the idea that the P_T-integrated and the P_T-differential cross
sections can be treated as two different observables. The colour-octet NRQCD
parameters needed to predict the P_T-integrated yield can thus be extracted
from the fits of the P_T-differential cross sections at mid and large P_T. For
the first time, the total cross section is evaluated in NRQCD at full NLO
accuracy using the recent NLO fits of the P_T-differential yields at RHIC, the
Tevatron and the LHC. Both the normalisation and the energy dependence of the

described by the alpha_s^3 contribution in the colour-singlet model --which, at
alpha_s^4, however shows an unphysical energy dependence. A similar observation
is made for eta(c,b). This calls for a full NNLO or for a resummation of the
initial-state radiation in this channel. In any case, past claims that

another peaks around 4.5 GeV can also be produced by the ATS. We also show that

This process is different from the triangle diagram and its threshold
enhancement only appears as CUSP effects if there is no pole structure or the

initial condition of heavy-ion collisions. The standard technique of analysing
heavy-ion collisions in bins of centrality obtained from final state
multiplicity averages out the various initial configurations and thus restricts
the study to only a limited range of initial conditions. In this paper, we
propose an additional binning in terms of total spectator neutrons in an event.
This offers us a key control parameter to probe events with broader range of
initial conditions providing us an opportunity to peep into events with rarer
initial conditions which otherwise get masked when analysed by centrality
binning alone. We find that the inclusion of spectator binning allows one to
vary $\varepsilon_2$ and $\varepsilon_3$ independently. We observe that the
standard scaling relation between $\displaystyle{v_2/\varepsilon_2}$ and
$\frac{1}{S}\frac{dN_{\text{ch}}}{d\eta}$ exhibited by centrality bins is
broken by the spectator neutron bins. However, the acoustic scaling relation
between $\displaystyle{\ln\left( v_n/\varepsilon_n\right)}$ and transverse
system size holds for both centrality as well as spectator bins for central to
mid-central collisions. The introduction of the spectator binning allows us to
tune over a wide range viscosity driven effects for events with varying initial
states but similar final state multiplicity.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.02338v2,[],[]
